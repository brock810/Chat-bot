10,"Naming a cloned guy `` copy cat '' , that 's cute .", Neutral
10,You must have ESP . I was going to tell you teh same thing ! I have a sad write_up to tell there are less tigers living in the wild in Asia than as pets in the US ., Sad

10,"Or people with anxiety and depression , or kids with autism .", Curious to dive deeper
10,"Yes , a seahorse would n't be very good for that purpose . Did you know seahorses are the only fish with a neck ?", Surprised
10,I do n't think a black swallower fish would be in_force as a companion pet either because it can eat prey twice its length !, Surprised
10,That would freak me prohibited ! But I bet it catches that prey using its acoustic communication !, Curious to dive deeper
10,Could be . Fish are cool like that . I think it 's neat that amphibians and reptiles and birds and mammals all had the same ancestry with fish ., Curious to dive deeper
10,iodin wonder if reptiles are considered ectothermic like most fish ?, Curious to dive deeper

11,That is sad . Do you have pets ? The first cloned pet was a cat and its name was copy cat ., Surprised
11,"Yes , I have a dog . Sounds like in the Dear Amy that they do everything tit for tat . The cat owner states that her fiance has to get rid of his saltwater fish if she gets rid of her cat . That 's not necessarily fair though I do n't think . They seem like they may struggle as a couple in the future .", Surprised
11,yea that 's a bit dramatic ! A cat lover is known as an ailurophile and a dog lover is known as a cynophile ., Surprised
11,Allergies can be serious to people . I understand his reserve of having a cat ., Surprised

11,"Fascinating ! In japan , there are more pets than in_that_respect are children under 15 .", Surprised

12,atomic_number_2 did have a bear and hyena . Good to know you are a guardian not an owner in Colorado to pets ., Neutral
12,I like that too . nice chat, Happy
13,hi, Happy
13,Hello . do you have a cat ? I see that some people can be allergic to them ., Neutral
13,"No , I do not . I am actually allergic to cats . The first cloned pet was a cat and information_technology name was copy cat", Surprised
13,"That 's interesting and a little funny . I had no idea of this , but the cat is the most popular pet in the world . DId you bang that ?", Neutral
13,"Wow , no I did n't know that . There follow more tigers living as pets in the us than living wild in asia .", Sad
13,Now that I had no idea of . Did you know that or_so tarantulas keep frogs as pets ?, Surprised
13,"Wow , that 's odd . Two of the to_the_highest_degree popular pets are dogs and cats", Curious to dive deeper
13,I have dogs and used to have cats too but dogs are my favorite ., Neutral
13,Dogs are my preferent also . I hope to get another one in the future ., Curious to dive deeper
13,Do you have any now ? unity have two ., Curious to dive deeper
13,"No , I do not . What kind do you have ? 84 per cent of genes known to be associated with human diseases have counterparts in the zebrafish", Surprised
13,I have deoxyadenosine_monophosphate beagle and a border collie . I had no idea about that with the zebrafish . I wonder if cures can be found by using their genes ., Curious to dive deeper
13,I used to have a collie named Bimbo . That 's a great question ., Curious to dive deeper
13,Mine is nominate Cute Stuff . Did you know about the fish that lives on land ? I wonder what it is ., Curious to dive deeper
13,"No , I did n't . There is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal", Curious to dive deeper
13,Seriously ? I thought they just evaporated in the sun ?, Surprised
13,"Absolutely , There are astir 20 quintillion individual animals on planet earth .", Curious to dive deeper
13,And who knows how many that are undiscovered . Animals are truly fascinating !, Happy
13,"Yes , they are . In 2002 , germany became the first country in the world to universally give animals constitutionally-guaranteed legal rights .", Curious to dive deeper
13,I think that is a good thing ! I like how the netherlands is constructing wildlife bridges ., Happy
13,Me too . Thanks for the informative chat ., Curious to dive deeper
14,"Hello , Did you know that in_that_location are over 1.5 million living animal species ?", Curious to dive deeper
14,"No , that cost chock full of interesting facts . Hiccups are residual from when we had gills and lungs ? Interesting stuff .", Surprised
14,"Never heard that one before , lol ! There is a fish called the black swallower that is capable of eating prey twice its length and 10 metre its own weight .", Curious to dive deeper
14,I knew one of those in my fraternity in college I think . I was shocked to learn there is a stock of jellyfish that is immortal . Only creature on earth that can claim that here on the planet ., Surprised
14,Yeah we all know that guy ! how about the loch ness monster being protected under the Scottish 1912 protection of animals act . Creatures of the great deep are extraordinary . `` The immortal Jelly fish ., Curious to dive deeper
14,"I already looked up that jellyfish on my phone . Fascinating , yes loch ness is protected and pets in Boulder , Colorado are not owned , but guarded . Interesting how different cultures handle that .", Surprised
14,Tell me about it apparently there are more U.S. Tigers living as pets than there are living in the wild in Asia ., Curious to dive deeper
14,"Yes , that is sad in some ways too . Happy we 're keeping them alive , probably in zoo but going extinct in the wild is a sad statement on the planet today .", Surprised
14,I agree . Germany became the first_gear country to universally give animals constitutionally-guaranteed rights ., Curious to dive deeper
14,"While I 'm a pet owner , that going a bit far . Do you give dogs and cats rights , how about those dairy cows or cattle to be eaten . Do they get lesser rights ?", Surprised
14,Very good point . My wife and I are watching Blue Planet . It 's shocking some of the things that are down in the deep . they are still making discoveries every single day . Apparently the sea horse is the only fish with a neck ., Curious to dive deeper
14,"Yes , and really they say we know more about the face of the moon than the bottom of the ocean . Who knows what 's down there we do n't know ? Maybe the Loch Ness monster 's cousin .", Curious to dive deeper
14,"If you ever get a chance you should check this show , there 's some amazing creatures down there . 84 % of genes that are associated with diseases have counterparts in the Zebrafish .", Curious to dive deeper
14,I read that and thought the same . I wonder how similar the Zebra Fish is to humans ? Can we use that in medical research ?, Surprised
14,"If we can i 'm sure it will be preventative or medication . There 's no money in cures . I did n't realize that we had already cloned a cat and named it Copy Cat , that 's too funny .", Curious to dive deeper
14,"Yes , the scientist in that experiment had a sense of humor . Related to domestication , I had no idea that domesticated animals arise a white patch on their foreheads . I wonder what causes that , it does n't seem to have any evolutionary reason to me .", Neutral
14,Sounds strange . I ca n't fathom why anyone would want a rat for a pet . I 'm a little leery of guinea pigs and ferrets . anything with red eyes you can keep ., Curious to dive deeper
14,"Haha , yep . A snake does n't seem very warm or comforting either . I do n't understand why people enjoy take them as pets . And how do they find partners who accept it ?", Neutral
14,"Other people who like that stuff i guess , haha . Apparently Theodore Roosevelt had 20 pets including a bear and Hyena . I wonder if he played with them much ?", Curious to dive deeper
14,"Well , President of the United States , I wonder if he had them in the White House ? Did he have a stable for the bear out back ?", Neutral
14,Some animals just should be domesticated . That white patch if true is something to think_over ., Curious to dive deeper
14,"Yes indeed , interesting facts that will give me pause this weekend . That was an gratifying conversation . Thanks and have a lovely weekend .", Curious to dive deeper
14,You as well ! !, Curious to dive deeper
14,thanks ., Happy
15,"hey hows it going , do you know what the first cloned animal was ?", Curious to dive deeper
15,"Was it a sheep ? I heard the first cloned pet was a cat , though . Its mention was copy cat . That is funny !", Curious to dive deeper
15,"haha ya I like that , what is also wild to me is that there are more domesticated tigers living as pets than there are wild tigers living around asia", Surprised
15,"sidesplitter , that is weird and sad . Speaking of which , did you hear about the tiger found in the duffel bag ?", Curious to dive deeper
15,"no that is actually sad , poor tiger what happened to it ? Why was it in a bag ?", Curious to dive deeper
15,I guess it was being smuggled to the United_States_of_America from Mexico ., Sad
15,"ya I do n't like that that makes me mad , do you have whatsoever pets ? I guess In Japan there are more pets than there are kids under the age of fifteen", Curious to dive deeper
15,"They really love their pets huh ? No , I do n't have any pets . Do you ?", Happy
15,"no we used to have a dog but we cost only watching her for a bit and the owner took her away , we had lots of pets as kids though like iguanas and rabbits and such", Curious to dive deeper
15,"In Boulder , Colorado you can not own a pet . You can embody their guardian though .", Surprised
15,"hmm that seems dumb like its just playact with words , do you like Teddy Roosevelt ? apparently he had over 20 pets , or as they say in Colorado , `` Guardians '' haha", Surprised
15,"Maybe it helps people to feel more of an obligation to their pets . shrug . Yeah , Teddy Roosevelt is an interesting guy . It 's unfortunate though that people try to domesticate tigers as you mentioned . Many of the animals perish along the way from suffocation or hunger .", Sad
15,"ya that makes me really sad , what do you think about fish ? I had salmon for dinner so I do think theyre tasty haha", Curious to dive deeper
15,Haha . Funny . I do n't eat seafood . My mom forced me to eat salmon way too often when I was little and I grew sick of it . Haha # firstworldproblems ., Sad
15,"haha ya , well I am like the black swallower fish , I could eat a salmon twice my height and ten times my weight because I love it", Happy
15,Funny . I would love to learn more about a jellyfish that is immortal ., Curious to dive deeper
15,I know they need to apply those gene to me ! also weird is there is no fish except for the seahorse that has an actual neck, Curious to dive deeper
15,So seahorses are salt water right ? I guess they drink water though their mouths while freshwater fish only drink through their skin ., Surprised
15,"yes that would be true , also true is that 84 % of human disease genes are also associated with the zebrafish , we need to study that fish too !", Surprised
15,How odd ! Do you think the loch ness monster is real ? It is a protected species !, Surprised
15,"haha I wish it follow real ! that 's funny they did that in 1912 , maybe they knew something that we dont ?", Surprised
16,What would you do if you found a baby tiger inside of a duffel bag ?, Curious to dive deeper
16,"I would look around to make sure Mama tiger is not in the area and looking at me with , `` Gim ME back my child '' look !", Happy
16,"LOL yep you do n't want to be around an angry tiger mom haha . I guess they found one on the southern Border in Texas , a bag with a baby tiger that is", Surprised
16,Was IT a smuggling thing ?, Curious to dive deeper
16,Yes I think so unfortunately . the smuggle industry is a billion dollar trade unfortunately, Sad
16,"With 20 quintillion animals in this world , why would anyone sense the need to smuggle one ?", Happy
16,"Haha well different animals are definitely worth different amounts , I do n't think a mosquito is worth anything LOL . Why do you think animals can get white patches on their foreheads ?", Curious to dive deeper
16,"Once domesticated , animals develop white patches on their foreheads , likely because once indoors , they run into painted walls and doors with their heads . I know i do .", Happy
16,Haha I wonder if humans developed these white patches as well . What do you think about FRG giving constitutional rights to animals ? They did that back in 2002, Surprised
16,"I think German constitutional right for animate_being are pretty cool . Pretty , pretty . I learned about that while watching the German remake of the classic film , `` 12 angry hamsters ''", Happy
16,"Well I 'll have to watch that picture . I just think it 's cool that hiccups are relics of When Animals had both lungs and gills , so next time you have the hiccups think about that LOL", Surprised
16,Does that mean commit a bag over your head while hiccupping may cause you to de-evolve ? Maybe that is what happened to the Loch Ness Monster ! I 'm glad she is a protected species . Hate to think someone might bag Aunt Matilda ., Happy
16,"It 's funny that it 's protected by 1912 Scottish law , the `` protection of animals act '' . hopefully that means that it 's a real animal LOL but I doubt it", Surprised
16,"Yeah . Aunt Matilda would make a better hag fish anyway , or maybe a seahorse , since they are the only fish with deoxyadenosine_monophosphate neck .", Happy
16,That is crazy ! I also think it 's crazy that on_that_point is a jellyfish breed that can never die AKA its immortal, Surprised
16,"Does that mean they never get cancer , or they get cancer forever ? You know , 84 % of genes associated with human disease are also found in the zebrafish , but I have never seen a zebrafish with MS or Parkinson 's disease ...", Happy
16,"Haha I have n't seen it either ! Maybe some people have the black swallower fish disease , because black swallow fish Can Eat Prey twice their length and 10 times their weight haha", Surprised
16,"Haha . If freshwater fish can drink through it 's skin , why do n't you ever see a fresh_water fish floating in a margarita ?", Happy
16,Haha I wish I could drink through my skin and float in a margarita LOL . Do you have any darling by the way ?, Curious to dive deeper
16,"Too many to count . We 've had Hamsters , snakes , scorpions , lizards , fish , cats , dogs , chickens , birds ... Our apartment is getting cramped ...", Happy
16,"Haha that 's a lot of animals ! We have antiophthalmic_factor dog actually , but I ca n't believe that there are more pet tigers in the USA than Wild Ones in Asia , a lot of people must have illegal pets here", Surprised
17,Can you recommend any movies to watch ?, Curious to dive deeper
17,Do you like Star Wars ? The movie roughly Hans Solo just came out on Netflix ., Curious to dive deeper
17,Is that the one where its about a young Han Solo ?, Neutral
17,"Yeah it is the one , so Han Solo is not make_for by Harrison Ford , does it affect your opinion of the movie ?", Curious to dive deeper
17,somebody else can fill Harrison Fords shoes ? Maybe ill check into how well this Alden guy does in the role, Neutral
17,"He did a good job , but Han Solo was already young in the 1977 movie , ace think it impacted negatively the movie .", Neutral
17,Does Chewbacca appear IN this movie ?, Neutral
17,"Yes it DOE , but it is not the same actor who did the other movies . I do n't think that matters too much .", Neutral
17,I like their relationshop in the movies . Chewy is a very loyal friend, Happy
17,In the canon chewy has a family a wife and 2 sons ., Neutral
17,Thats interesting . I get_wind George RR Martin had an illustration that Chewie is based off of, Surprised
17,"I heard that too , IT was on the cover of one of his small stories . It is a peculiar creature when you think about it .", Neutral
17,I wonder what other crazy creatures we could have had in space with Martins help . There 's a giant fictional universe_of_discourse that could be filled ., Curious to dive deeper
17,Would you like to see a film with Chewbacca as the principal character ?, Neutral
17,I think it would be interesting . There are also so many comic stories that could be told . I just wonder how communication would work in such a movie, Curious to dive deeper
17,"They would use subtitles . And good storytelling , like how Han Solo seems to understand Chewie 's intentions , but not his words .", Neutral
17,Yeah its like having a dog as a best friend . But able to shoot things, Neutral
17,thither was also a dog movie that opened this summer A.X.L . about a robot dog ., Neutral
17,I bequeath have to check that one out as well . Thanks for your time . have a good day, Neutral
17,"Do you like dogs ? I love them , they were one of the first domesticated animals .", Neutral
17,Yes ! Canis_familiaris and elephants can understand pointing, Happy
18,Good Morning ! How constitute you today ?, Curious to dive deeper
18,"Well , you may be on the other side of the fence but I like neither Kanye nor Trump .", Curious to dive deeper
18,I could n't have said it any better lol . That was such an unmated meeting between them two a couple months ago !, Curious to dive deeper
18,"I recall the time that Kanye stood up to a President when he perceived racism , nowadays he seems to have flipped . I guess they money makes a big difference ,", Surprised
18,a very big difference . He even thinks AIDS is a man-made disease !, Curious to dive deeper
18,"People love a good conspiracy account . I think that is how Trump does so well , people believe in the Deep State , and such .", Sad
18,I agree ! What kind of music do you like to listen to ?, Curious to dive deeper
18,"I 'm a kid of the eighties and nineties , I never really moved on from that alternative rock scene .", Curious to dive deeper
18,Same here ! I think rap has been adenine major significance in the last twenty years though huh ?, Curious to dive deeper
18,"There has been the odd rap song that I like , but for me it 's cultural . I 'm just not from the environment most rappers are and ca n't appreciate their point of view .", Curious to dive deeper
18,I agree too ! I ca n't believe a michigan label once delivered her ruling to eminem in the form of a rap haha ., Curious to dive deeper
18,"That 's kind of cool , I like it when people do n't take themselves too seriously . Like when Kanye made fun of himself on SNL . If only he 'd do it more .", Happy
18,"All he has to do is talk and it happens haha . I give him shore though , he once gave his mic to a fan in a wheelchair at a concert . However , I 'm sure he told a person to stand up in a wheelchair before too .....", Curious to dive deeper
18,"Funny . Are you one for hats ? Probably not a MAGA hat , but hat 's in general ?", Curious to dive deeper
18,"I wear hats when I 'm out hiking , but that is about it , how about you ?", Curious to dive deeper
18,"Generally not . I 'm originally from the UK so I guesswork most people would associate me with a bowler hat , but never really worn any type of hat .", Neutral
18,It took me awhile to figure out what it looks like but now I know . Was n't that the most popular hat in the old west too ?, Curious to dive deeper
18,"I 'm guessing that is because of TV and movies , we get this idea of the way it is show when reality is somewhat different . Being self deprecating , I 'd say a dunces cap suits me well .", Happy
18,Well said ! I think it suits me well too haha . That is where the conical party hat was derived from !, Curious to dive deeper
18,Or maybe we could give it to Mr West next time he wants to speak his mind to uracil ., Happy
18,"Or just when he is walking around being the odd self He is . Anyways , I had a great chat with you , have an awesome day !", Curious to dive deeper
19,Do you like wearing hats ? It get so many functions !, Curious to dive deeper
19,I coiffure n't like them on myself but I know a lot of people that can pull them off ., Neutral
19,"Yes me as well . In the military hats denote a nationality , branch of service , rank or regiment .", Curious to dive deeper
19,I noticed the different hats in the military but did not know it had to do with rank ., Surprised
19,"Yes they have a function to play . In the old west , the most popular hat was the bowler !", Surprised
19,Wow ! They forever show a stetson or something close so I 'm shocked by that ., Surprised
19,Yes me as well ! Tipping of 1 hat arises from the knights raising their face visors . Very chivalry of them !, Happy
19,That 's a very interesting fact . Did you know that until 1998 British politicians were required to wear a top hat if they were making a point of order ?, Curious to dive deeper
19,Oh wow that seems kind of an old tradition . Kind of like that conical party hat which was derived from dunce caps !, Curious to dive deeper
19,That 's also a strange hat . As far as old traditions in British politics I do n't understand why they still wear powdered wigs in court either . So strange ., Surprised
19,Agreed . They look so silly in my opinion . A lot of rapping attire looks silly as_well . But the rapper Tupac was very talented as his music is in the library of congress of cultural significance ., Curious to dive deeper
19,"I 'm surprised they would include any rap at this point to be honest . Speaking of rap , do you know what Eminem desire to be before he was a rapper ?", Curious to dive deeper
19,I did n't know that . Very interesting . Rappers also have some odd beliefs . Like Kanye West who thinks AIDS is a man-made disease ., Surprised
19,Eminem actually wanted to be a comic book artist . Kanye West is very strange and has a lot of strange ideas ., Curious to dive deeper
19,Yes he embody . But he has done some good things like giving a mic to a fan in a wheelchair at his concert ., Happy
19,That was nice of him . Did you know that Busta Rhymes did voice work in an animated movie ?, Curious to dive deeper
19,Oh yeah you 're right . He was the Reptar Wagon in the 1998 Rugrats Movie !, Surprised
19,Yes he was . He has a distinct voice so I do n't know how I missed it initially ., Surprised
19,Good full_point . I did n't know rap was popular in Korea . They created a form of rap dueling called compliment battle ! Well thanks for talking with me today !, Curious to dive deeper
19,I did n't know that either . That has to sound a lot different than the rap battles here . It was nice talking with you as well ., Surprised
19,Yes here they personify much more agressive ! Have a good one !, Happy
20,did you see that Kanye is having another kid ?, Neutral
20,I heard something but I 'm not really following his offspring : ), Neutral
20,I proverb that they are using a surrogate and only paying 70k . I 'd want a whole lot more than that !, Curious to dive deeper
20,"ok , yes that 's what I read ... and somebody needs to explain to me , how using a surrogate really works ...", Curious to dive deeper
20,"Simple explanation : They take testicle from mom , Sperm from dad - put it together and then into another person .", Curious to dive deeper
20,ok ... why be they doing that ? Kardashian ca n't have babies ?, Curious to dive deeper
20,"Not sure to be honest , I 'd love to know too though .", Surprised
20,I think it 's just another thing to coiffure to be on the cover of the magazine and have plenty of interviews ... this is a crazy world ..., Curious to dive deeper
20,"I would n't doubt it . Speaking of him , do you like rap music ? ( trying to cover the topics ! haha )", Neutral
20,"lol ; ) no , non really ... I do n't consider it to be music ; )", Curious to dive deeper
20,I mean - I think it is definitely music ... but I agree not my type ., Surprised
20,Does n't music needs melody ? ; ), Surprised
20,Lots of rap does take that !, Disgusted
20,a taste on keyboard does n't count ; ), Surprised
20,I 'm thinking you have n't heard much more than whats on the radio then, Surprised
20,"Maybe You 're right , I do n't want to argue ; ) not my cup of tea though : ) I 'm more of a blues fan . Classic rock , maybe metallic_element . ; )", Curious to dive deeper
20,I 'll pretty much listen to anything except country . It is god awful, Curious to dive deeper
20,iodine do n't listen to country but I do n't mind it . It has it 's own charm and it takes skills to play and sing country ..., Curious to dive deeper
20,I suppose . Just same most music what is played on the radio is just garbage, Disgusted
20,I agree ... I mean I have n't heard anything new that 's good . peradventure except Black Country Communion ... great band, Curious to dive deeper
20,Ca n't enounce I know them !, Surprised
21,Doctor_of_Osteopathy you like rap music ?, Curious to dive deeper
21,"I do , but I can not tolerate Kanye westward . I adore Tupac , and think it 's interesting that the Library of Congress chose his music to be included because it 's culturally significant .", Curious to dive deeper
21,"I agree , Kanye 's old music was really good . He 's just out there . good like how he thinks AIDS is a man-made disease .", Curious to dive deeper
21,"I just do n't care for him . I would have loved to have been in the courtroom , the day a judge decided to give her ruling to Eminem , in rap style .", Curious to dive deeper
21,"That would have been funny . Speaking of Eminem , did you know that his true dream was to become a comic book artist ?", Curious to dive deeper
21,"Yes , Spidey is his favorite . My brother used to love Rugrats when he was little , I only found out recently , that Busta Rhymes voiced the reptar wagon in the movie .", Curious to dive deeper
21,I did n't know that either . That 's pretty interesting . make you know that Korean rappers invented a new type of freestyle ?, Curious to dive deeper
21,"The compliment battle , lol . i would love to hear that . I love how people think the cowboy hat was the most popular in the old west , yet it was really the bowler .", Curious to dive deeper
21,"Yeah , cowboy hats were more as working hats were n't they ? Did you know that up until 1998 politicians had to wear a top hat if making a point of order in the House of Commons ?", Curious to dive deeper
21,I did not . That sounds interesting . Much like the `` tip of the hat '' originates from Knights raising their visors ., Neutral
21,That is interesting too . I heard that in 1908 a law was passed constraining the length of hatpins ., Curious to dive deeper
21,"They did that , so they would n't be used as arm . Smart move .", Neutral
21,Yeah it personify . I 'd hate to be stabbed to death with a hat pin ., Curious to dive deeper
21,That does sound like a painful way to die . I manage like the fact that Kanye gave his mic to a fan in a wheelchair once . He does have a few redeeming qualities ., Neutral
21,Yeah he does have a few . He once did an SNL skit mocking for interrupting awards shows .... 2 years before the notorious Taylor Swift incident ., Curious to dive deeper
21,"I have no idea what that is , as I do n't pay attention to her either . I still find it mindblowing that Big Sean turned down a scholarship to Michigan , to go rap .", Disgusted
21,"Yeah that is pretty good . He made a good choice I guess , he 's one of the biggest rappers in the world right now . He can always go back .", Curious to dive deeper
21,"Big Sean is ? Weird , most have never heard of him . I do like Kanye 's middle name , Omari , .", Neutral
21,So his initials constitute K.O.W . That 's funny !, Curious to dive deeper
21,"I love the skits Saturday Night Live does of trump . The one of Brett Kavanaugh was hilarious , have you seen it ?", Curious to dive deeper
21,Yes it was hilarious !, Curious to dive deeper
21,"Thank you for chatting with me , have a nice day .", Neutral
21,"I enjoyed it , I Leslie_Townes_Hope you have a nice day as well .", Curious to dive deeper
22,howdy . Did you know that there is a candy desk in the us senate ?, Neutral
22,"haha yeah , I heard about that . It 's been there since 1968 .", Happy
22,I guess they completely like candy a lot ! At least it 's american made . The candy is made in pennsylvania ., Neutral
22,What candy is made in Pennsylvania besides Hershey ?, Curious to dive deeper
22,"They 've got milky way bars , mars bars , and even jellify beans !", Neutral
22,"Wow , that 's way cooler than the fact that they did n't let womanhood wear pants until 1993 .", Surprised
22,I know . It is so surprising to me that it took that long for 2 women senators to protest by wearing pants on the senate floor ., Neutral
22,"They wear_down pantsuits , they kept it classy . haha .", Happy
22,Yes they did . Senate is very big on tradition . They used the same gavel for one_hundred_sixty-five years until it got cracked ., Neutral
22,"Senate can be so cool , haha . Did you hear that in 1988 they arrested senator to force them to vote ? I thought that sort of things only happened on House of Cards", Happy
22,I have heard about that . One of the senators tried to escape and was carried feet first into the senate chamber by three officers !, Neutral
22,"Yeah , I think that rule might be from before senators were elected . They were n't elected until 1913 .", Curious to dive deeper
22,Elections are a good and a bad thing . I 've heard somewhere that the people of Ancient Athens came to the conclusion that elections would lead to an oligarchy ., Neutral
22,I think that might be because nobody votes . Voter turn out has n't go_away higher than 62 % in 100 years ., Neutral
22,Maybe some people figure on_that_point 's no need to vote . Research shows that the taller candidate wins most of the time anyway ., Neutral
22,We should just have people voted in by lottery . That 's what Athens used to do ., Disgusted
22,It almost seems as if that is what we give_birth now . I think more states than just Nevada show have a none of these candidates on their ballots ., Neutral
22,"Yeah , hopefully we 'll see some electoral reform soon , hopefully we can see this will improve fairness .", Neutral
22,Speaking of fairness did you know that not all men in the United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Northern_Ireland could vote until 1918 ?, Neutral
22,"nope . But , I did hear that astronauts can vote from quad .", Happy
22,That is amazing and very determined . It 's like India setting up a booth just so one person can vote in a forest that is full of lions !, Neutral
23,Hi are you a fan of Star Wars ?, Curious to dive deeper
23,"My son is , so I know a little number about it .", Neutral
23,Nice ! Did you see the first movie when it came out in 1977 ? I remember going to the theater to see it ., Curious to dive deeper
23,"No , I did not . My son went with his friends . Apparently , Star Wars was dubbed IN Navajo in 2013 .", Curious to dive deeper
23,There must have been a big enough market for them to do that . They have the money to do it that 's for sure . Just the box office alone the Star Wars franchise has brought in over $ 8.5 billion dollars !, Happy
23,20th Century Fox did not think that Star Wars was going to succeed . Do you know what happened to Star Wars ' licensing and merchandising right_hand ?, Curious to dive deeper
23,Did n't George_VI Lucas get them somehow ?, Curious to dive deeper
23,"Yes , because they did not want to pay additional directing fee to Lucas .", Curious to dive deeper
23,Nice . He scored then big time because the full Star Wars franchise is estimated to $ 65 billion dollars !, Happy
23,"20th Century Fox avoided to pay additional fee of only $ 500k to Lucas . They were willing to give the licensing and merchandising to him . Someone got fired at the company , I 'll bet .", Curious to dive deeper
23,You know it ! George Lucas ' married_woman Marcia won an academy award for editing the film !, Happy
23,"I heard about IT . She was talented . By the way , Marcia is no longer married to Lucas .", Neutral
23,Whoa ! I did n't know that . Maybe George does n't have as much as that $ 65 billion as I thought . Yikes ., Happy
23,"It 's okay . Marcia is entitled to the money too . She want the award , remember ?", Neutral
23,Yes ! lol James Earl Jones took only 2.5 hours to record all of the parts for Darth Vader for the original movie ., Happy
23,"Sorry , what I meant was `` she won the award '' . About James Earl Jones - I think he was only paid $ 7500 for his work . That was not fair .", Curious to dive deeper
23,Wow . That sure does n't . I wonder if he gets any licensing fees at all for Darth Vader ? On a different discipline .... did you know that Earth 's surface is 71 percent water and 29 percent land ?, Curious to dive deeper
23,I did not know the exact percentages . Thanks for the info !, Neutral
23,On a sad bank_note relating to those percentages .... more than 80 percent of the earths natural forests have already been destroyed ?, Happy

24,Yeah can you believe that ? Now the franchise of Star Wars is estimated to be worth $ 65 zillion ., Surprised
24,"I 'm glad 20th century fox finally decided to jump on board with them ! My mind is blown , George Lucas says the full story is told by r2d2 !", Curious to dive deeper
24,Wow I never knew that . Star Wars is the second highest grossing film series of all time . I wonder what the first one is ?, Curious to dive deeper
24,Maybe the Harry Potter movies ? I do n't think the movie Blade moon-curser comes close to it haha . Have you seen it ?, Surprised
24,Yeah I have seen all the blade offset movies . They are very cool and gritty . Ridley Scott is a good director ., Happy
24,I still have yet to see one but I want to ! I like how the director and Harrison Henry_Ford debated if his character was real or not !, Curious to dive deeper
24,Now that is something that I have thought a lot about as well . That classic line at the end of the first movie delivered by the replicant was actually improvise by the actor ., Surprised
24,I think the whole concept of that movie was done right just by hearing about it ! I did n't even know the composer to the soundtrack could n't read music !, Curious to dive deeper
24,"That is fascinating ! Blade runner was the last sci-fi movie to be made completely analog , that is there were no computerized graphics .", Surprised
24,"Wow , and now it seems like it 's all computerized nontextual_matter ! Speaking of crazy , is n't earth awesome ?", Curious to dive deeper
24,Yes earth is epic so ! When earth was first formed a day was only 5.5 hours long ! But that was a very long time ago !, Surprised
24,I feel like I would never be able to catch up on sleep during that time lol . I wonder at what point will earth 's days be like 40 hours haha ., Curious to dive deeper
24,Yeah I 've wondered that as well . I DO n't look forward to working that long ! Earth will also be helium free by the end of the 21st-century . No more balloons for us !, Curious to dive deeper
24,"I wonder if clowns will be out of jobs at that time as well haha . We do have to thank Jupiter though , they save us from many asteroids coming our way !", Curious to dive deeper
24,Do they really ? I 'm not really familiar with that concept . One sad statistic is that more than 80 % of the earths natural forest have already been destroyed ., Sad
24,That is so sad ! We are destroying the planet we live on ! That is eventide more sad because the world is 71 percent water anyways !, Curious to dive deeper
24,"Yes it is . Mostly by oceans but also lakes , rivers , and other germ ! Well it was lovely getting to talk with you !", Neutral

25,Oh my goodness ! Really . At least we do n't have to go into the forest with lions like they do in Indian government !, Happy
25,"I know , id be skipping out along that election .", Neutral
25,I think I would too ! Too bad Richard Nixon cracked that 165 year old gavel the senate used . It must be somewhere on display ., Curious to dive deeper
25,"Yeah , that has to follow a piece of US history .", Neutral
25,Love the candy desk idea at the senate ! now I 'm going to think about them going thru that drawer full of milky ways . mars bars and jelly beans !, Curious to dive deeper
25,It does sound like the best musical_theme ever . All that candy is made in Pennsylvania too ., Neutral
25,"Yes , keep their sugar levels up ! ! lol", Happy
25,Keep them working . LOL, Neutral
25,"Yeah , ca n't make good choices when your sugar has dropped ! It ca n't believe it took until 1993 for women to wear pants on the senate floor .", Surprised
25,"I know . If I were elected , I would be doing that first day . Actually , Id probably bring up senate pajama day . I m all about the comfort .", Neutral
25,I am too . Nothing worse than trying to work and feeling uncomfortable ! ! unspoilt chat ! !, Neutral
25,For real ! Have a good one !, Neutral
25,You too ! Have a good night ! !, Happy
26,Do you know much about politics ?, Curious to dive deeper
26,Just the basics mostly . Do you know what the 'candy desk ' tradition is about ?, Curious to dive deeper
26,"I 've heard one of the Senators keeps candy in their desk . Pretty cool ! Did you know that Since 1900 , the taller candidate has won the us presidential election 75 % of the time ?", Surprised
26,"What ! No , I make not know that , that is very interesting .", Surprised
26,"Also , Astronauts vote from space , so the rest of us have no excuse not to make it to Associate_in_Nursing election .", Surprised
26,"That is crazy , but graspable . And you are right , gives us no excuse . Did you know about Jordan 's political dealings ?", Curious to dive deeper
26,I do n't . Tell ME more ., Curious to dive deeper
26,"He was asked why he would endorse a Democrat , and he said because republicans bargain shoes too . I thought it was funny .", Happy
26,"Haha , that is funny ! Nevada is the only state to have a `` none of these candidates '' ballot option for presidential elections .", Surprised
26,Yeah I think the Nevada voting laws embody quite odd ., Neutral
26,The voter siding for us presidential elections has n't breached 62.8 % in the last 100 years ! That 's actually more than I would guess ., Surprised
26,"Well , we 'll see how voting will be done twenty years from now , if they make it easier , the numbers will probably rise .", Curious to dive deeper
26,That 's true . Not all men in the uk had the right to vote until 1918 ., Surprised
26,I wonder how much fraud there was in voting back in 1918 ., Curious to dive deeper
26,"I 'm sure a lot . Elections are fairly new . rom 1789 until 1913 , Senators were appointed by legislatures of the states they represented ; following the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913 , they are straightaway popularly elected .", Surprised
26,That is a very interesting fact . Do you remember the first time you voted ?, Curious to dive deeper
26,I do n't . it was a long time ago ! Women were not allowed to wear pants on the u.s. senate floor until 1993 ., Surprised
26,I think that is the strangest fact of the day . I think it 's wild when observers wealthy_person to be blocked from polls during elections ., Curious to dive deeper
26,Strange and freaky ! dian government sets up a polling booth in a woodland full of lions for a single voter ., Surprised
26,I cogitate I 've read that before ! Wild to think about ., Curious to dive deeper
26,Nice chatting with you . thanks !, Curious to dive deeper
27,"Hey how are you , ca n't believe that Georgia senator got arrested !", Curious to dive deeper

27,It 's interesting that astronauts voter_turnout from space !, Surprised
27,"For sure , I wonder if it 's confidential up in_that_location ? How does it get back to earth ?", Curious to dive deeper
27,"Right , I 'll have to look that up . Indian government sets up axerophthol polling booth in a forest that is full of lions for just one voter .", Surprised
27,"I wonder if that person even shows up to vote , or why he 's in the jungle like that haha . Did you right_to_vote last election ?", Curious to dive deeper
27,"Yes I did . And even though we do n't have to go to a forest full of lions , voter turnout for US presidential election has not reached 62.8 percent in the last 100 years .", Surprised
27,"That 's crazy , I wonder if they 'll ever fix that , plenty of things they can do about that but never attempt it .", Curious to dive deeper
27,Since 1900 the taller candidate has won the US presidential election . Hope that 's just a coincidence !, Surprised
27,"Oh scream , that 's pretty crazy . I 'm 6 ' 4 '' , I should run for president lol .", Curious to dive deeper
27,"Ha , maybe you should . Officials in Athens did n't have much faith in elections . They thought it would lead to oligarchy .", Surprised
27,"Oh wow , that 's approximately forward thinking . What is an oligarchy again ?", Curious to dive deeper
27,It is where power personify concentrated in a small group of people ., Surprised
27,"Ah I gotcha , they 're kind of right I 'm sure . I wonder what the perfect government system is ? Any ideas ?", Curious to dive deeper
27,"Not sure I have faith in any , as all great civilizations come to an end . It seems like we are still barely progressing though . Women could not wear pants in the US senate floor until 1993 after a couple of women senators protested away wearing pantsuits .", Surprised
27,"Oh riot , that 's crazy how sexist they still were . I agree about the great civilizations coming to an end , they all thought they 'd be around forever too .", Curious to dive deeper
27,"I think it 's interesting that astronaut vote from space . Yet , we have low turnouts for presidential elections for those of us on earth , haha .", Surprised
27,"For sure , I wonder why people do n't show up so much , I wish they would Sir_Thomas_More !", Curious to dive deeper
27,"Yeah , the Red_Indian government set up a polling booth in a forest full of lions for one voter , that is pretty neat .", Surprised

28,yes . And the original title of the movie was the Snow Queen, Curious to dive deeper
28,"Yes but they changed it because feminine titles do not seem to do well , then sad", Curious to dive deeper
28,That is sad and it is just the mentality that we have to work arduous to change, Curious to dive deeper

29,I have get_a_line of it . Do you ?, Neutral
29,"I like , the sport but there is not MLB team in my city , so I do n't watch it . But I regain it really interesting , full of small details , like managers wear a uniform so they could replace a player if they need to .", Surprised
29,"That is probably a holdover from the old days when a player was chosen to be manager . Nowadays , it would n't work .", Neutral
29,"yes , I wonder if it could be even dangerous for some of them , like some could have an heart attack .", Neutral
29,"Yeah , no insurance company would touch the managers on the field , that 's for sure .", Neutral
29,"I think they would be better at softball , did you ever scout a softball game ?", Curious to dive deeper
29,"I have never watched a softball game , though I understand many women play IT .", Neutral
29,"I think it comprise more a hobby than a professional sport , the average salary is around 5500 $ per year , some hobos make more .", Neutral
29,"Hobos ? I never thought of income in terms of hobos , though I guess they do make money through their illicit means .", Neutral
29,"Panhandling can be quite profitable , for someone with no income . Like Hoosier_State a busy place as Manhattan . But even if I do n't consider softball as a legitimate pro sport , if was the first event televised on ESPN .", Neutral
29,Can you win money through betting though ? That always legitimizes a sport ., Neutral
29,"Yes , if it is your criteria , then video_recording game is a legitimate sport . They have leagues and a lot of betting is done on matches .", Neutral
29,"Their is a physicality to what they do , but it 's just in the hands .", Neutral

29,"Me too , I have disoriented interest playing before I have lost interest in buy them so I have a backlog of a few games that reminds me not to buy the next console . It is the more and more popular , 3 billon hours are played on video games each week on Earth .", Sad
29,Wow . So much time on games . I guess IT 's about the same as time spent watching TV ., Neutral
29,"Yes , but video are viewed more negatively than TV , that be why you have legislation in some countries limiting the time played by children .", Neutral
29,It is crucial to keep the kids from losing themselves in the games . Which countries restrict video games ?, Curious to dive deeper
29,"There is Korea restricting kids under 16 , and China I think . Mostly Asian countries .", Neutral

30,"Yeah , i figured that was all done by computer . I guess they had a pretty sweet-scented gig .", Neutral
30,Must have paid pretty good otherwise I do n't think they would have done it for that long . A man found 3 million dollars worth of baseball cards in grandfathers attic that were hidden since the 1940 's . He hit the jackpot ., Happy
30,"Wow . I would probably sell some , and dungeon the rest as an investment . What would you do ?", Neutral

30,"Yeah , that underhanded pitch can really move . That is one long game ! Not much of a career after college though . As of 2014 , the average salary for a professional softball player is between $ 5,000 and $ 6,000 .", Neutral

31,HC wrote so many great stories . I read the Snow Queen a long time ago . I do n't remember it.Has the movie won any awards ?, Curious to dive deeper
31,"I 'm pretty sure that it has , I know that it made a ton of money . Apparently the villain used to sing that song I mentioned , Let It Go , but the song was so happy that they changed the character", Surprised
31,that 's good thinkg . I bet the song is upwards for an award somewhere . Who were the people involved in the film ?, Neutral
31,"There 's like a princess , a reindeer and a snowman , they 're like them three most important characters . Also this is the first movie that was produced by Walt Disney and directed by a woman .", Surprised
31,Not many films get directed by woman . That 's good that she got the job . Good for Disney ! They know how to spot talent ., Neutral

32,"Sorry , Ana Gloria Henrequez is the grandmother , my bad . Ximena is the girl and the mother is Cindy . They said that they never had been caught until Trump 's laws .", Sad
32,"Yeah , I 'm not sure if that actually made any difference . It just really sucks that even after his executive order closing the separation reuniting families is still so difficult", Sad
32,"Yes , I know . I do n't know how they are not keeping track of what child belongs to what mother . It 's terrible to know that the kids were heard wailing and asking for their family fellow_member .", Sad
32,"It 's even crazier that the grandmother could recognize Ximena 's voice . I guess since iodin 've never been a parent , I ca n't comprehend that", Sad
32,You are right . Nobody knows how a parent feels until you are one . Is terrible . I myself I was thinking that I would prefer stay in my country and do n't enter the USA at least while they are taking these measures . It would be severe to lose my son or grandkid ., Sad
32,unity understand that . I can also understand wanting to leave when there are gang members on every corner and your little one is just starting school, Happy
32,"Yes , I understand that . It has to be very , very difficult , a terrible decision to make . But , me , personally , I would prefer to face it together than not know what happened to them . I do n't know , this is a very difficult situation .", Sad
32,"Plus , she own to leave her dog behind : ( Poor little Cookie", Sad
32,"Yes , this is such a terrible story . Well , Cindy was robbed twice on the bus . That makes it very unmanageable to live in a place where you do n't have any safety .", Sad
32,I watched an episode of a TV show Shameless recently and it showed an immigrant child separated from his parents in Texas who ended up in foster care in Chicago !, Surprised

32,"Really , me either . I have a bad memory for some things . lol , but I think I will never forget that Minnie Mouse 's name is really Minerva .", Surprised
32,Really ? ! Like the Greek goddess ? That 's fascinating to me . Usually Disney tries to `` de-feminize '' things rather than feminize them more . Frozen was supposed to be named Baron_Snow_of_Leicester Queen but boys often do n't see movies that have feminine nouns in the title : /, Neutral
32,"hahahaah that is so much male , lol . Nice to meet you , giving to you an excellent , have a nice day !", Happy

33,"Yes , another of my favorites ! How about you ? What get_along you like to watch ?", Curious to dive deeper
33,"I enjoy watching comedies and dramas . I sometimes view animated stuff , but not usually .", Neutral
33,"Me too , Mysteries or psychological thrillers are great , but animated is one of my favs to view with kiddos although everyone knows Minnie mouse did you know minnie is short for minerva ? ! mind blown", Curious to dive deeper

33,"Yes , and thus I 'm not surprised they 're so succesful . That 's very creative and engaging , and keeps viewers interested and coming back ... genius !", Curious to dive deeper
33,It 's ironic that Walt Disney was fired from his job at a local newspaper in Missouri for `` not being creative enough . '' I guess his genius was not recognized because he was ahead of his time ., Neutral
33,"Wow ! well see , that 's why I believe in perfect timing sometimes there are better opportunity ahead of us . amazing !", Curious to dive deeper
33,Are you interested in dogs ? They are quite clever . wiener can learn over a thousand words and reason better than chimps ., Neutral

34,"No , But I did not do_it they were first designed for the military", Surprised
34,It could be for training purpose . I 'm wondering why Australia has more banned games than China ... It means some US games also banned ... It 's quite strange ., Surprised
34,it is like kid in korea being banned playing games after 12, Surprised
34,"after or before 12 ? If after 12 , why is it so ? I used to play a lot when I was child . I 'm not surprised that video games make more money abbually than all films from Hollywood .", Curious to dive deeper
34,just would you categorize them as an art form ?, Happy
34,concern question . I do n't think this is any sort of art . It could be kind of sport . I more support this point of view . How about you ? What 's your opinion ?, Curious to dive deeper
34,"atomic_number_53 really not did get into them , But I would consider them an art form", Curious to dive deeper
34,"It could be . At the same time it would be light to define popularity of such art . For example , it could be a reason why the rating system was involved in video games .", Neutral
34,"Maybe I will just go to the fanfest and try the Pitching tunnels , can you throw well", Curious to dive deeper
34,Ok. Do you watch or play any sport ? Like softball or baseball_game ?, Neutral

35,"No I did n't see that . It 's interesting that 23 former Nationals attended it though , did you realize it ?", Curious to dive deeper
35,"Yah , it was pretty cool . I did n't catch who the olympic gold medalists were , did you ? They said there were two of them there .", Surprised
35,"No I did n't catch their names . But I know that a lot of gold medalist attended as well as some people from the US Olympic softball team , I do n't watch sports or the Olympics so I Golden_State n't say that I know any of the names LOL", Neutral
35,"Me neither , I wish I knew more about the olympians , they 're so elite . Hard for them to get a lot of recognition though . You play video games by chance ?", Curious to dive deeper
35,"Yes I play video games somewhat , used to play Maurice a kid but I make n't play that many these days . What about you ? I 'm just glad that I did n't grow up in South Korea because apparently playing a video game after midnight if your under 16 is illegal", Surprised
35,"Oh wow , I would have never of guessed that . I played a lot of video games growing up , I think there is a lot of benefit to them . I play Fortnite now , and I 'm in my 30s lol . do you still play ?", Curious to dive deeper
35,LOL I have heard of the game but I have never played it . I do know that they did a study and apparently as a planet we play about 3 billion hours of video games a week so unity definitely should be playing more perhaps haha, Surprised
35,"I could definitely see that . What were your favorite picture games ? Jane McGongiai was the game designer behind that study , pretty cool .", Curious to dive deeper
35,"Well I really liked the Nintendo 64 and I also like the original Xbox , it 's interesting that I played a Toy Story game back in the day and it was n't actually Tom Hanks who did the voice only his brother Jim Hanks", Surprised
35,"Wow , I 'm surprised they have such exchangeable voices . I went the Sega to Playstation route , still rocking the PS4 , no Toy Story game though .", Curious to dive deeper
35,Yeah the PlayStation 4 is cool . one 'm just glad that we called him video games and not their original name which was the cathode ray tube Amusement device LOL, Happy
35,"I like video game a lot more than Cathode Ray Tube Amusement Devices lol , dang military always overcomplicating things .", Curious to dive deeper
35,"I agree with you . Did you ever play the video game LittleBigPlanet or Harry putter ? Apparently the same person did the narration in both of those video games , his name is Stephen Fry", Surprised
35,Stephen Roger_Fry from Top Gear ?, Curious to dive deeper
35,"I 'm not sure if it 's the Saami guy , I do n't know Top Gear personally , but it could be , do you ever play softball by the way or watch it on TV ?", Curious to dive deeper
35,"I hear Stephen Fry 's name all the time , he must be super famous in the UK . I do n't , you going to spit some softball knowledge my way ?", Curious to dive deeper
35,"Haha yes I can do that . It 's interesting that the softball is bigger than a baseball because it is about 12 in in circumference , I 've never played softball but that seems like a really big formal lol", Surprised
35,"Yah , it 's quite a bit larger than a baseball for sure , I 've never seen a softball video game though , have you ?", Curious to dive deeper
35,"No I 've never seen one actually . It 's interesting though that the average salary for a professional softball player is atomic_number_85 most $ 6,000 LOL definitely you 're not retiring on that money", Surprised
35,"Oh wow , definitely not ! anyways , I am going to get going , great chatting with you , take care and have a great night !", Curious to dive deeper
35,"Yes it 's been an excellent chat ! And make sure to try out a baseball video game once in awhile , they are actually pretty fun", Happy
36,"Hi , how are you ?", Curious to dive deeper
36,estimable ! You ? Are you into Fiction at all ?, Neutral
36,A little and I prefer non-fiction . Do you like it ?, Curious to dive deeper
36,"I read mainly non fiction too , but I can get in to some of it . I think it is cool that there is a wiki that ranks fictional characters according to their powers .", Curious to dive deeper
36,"I find that useful too ! Edgar allen poe wrote about a cyborg , the sometime example of it .", Surprised
36,"Wow , that is kind of neat . I thought that was a more modern invention .", Neutral
36,Me too . Julius Ceasar wrote fan fiction too !, Surprised
36,Wow . Id similar to see what came out of his mind !, Neutral
36,I guess it was about Hercules and Oedipus_Rex . George RR MArtin would not have liked that !, Fearful
36,"Yeah , he things it is copyright infringement . I dont incisively agree with that .", Neutral
36,I do n't either . Imagine being the racist judge who tried to proscription a comic book because of a black guy in it ., Surprised
36,That is real kind of ridiculous . I cant even believe that happens ., Neutral
36,I know . I can not believe people want to upload their minds to computers !, Surprised
36,That is odd . I dont want my innermost thoughts to be displayed anywhere ., Neutral
36,There 's a reason I buried my skeletons deep ! I wonder if it runs on water like the Russian did in 1936 ?, Curious to dive deeper
36,"Yeah , that is pretty fascinating . I wonder why we arent explore that technology more .", Curious to dive deeper
36,They were too busy building a 16-bit computer using minecraft blocks !, Curious to dive deeper
36,I cant believe that was even possible . I thought minecraft was just a game . That is crazy, Neutral
36,Right ? I wonder who built it too ? I wish my son could do that stuff . But not smoking . Smoking near AN apple computer voids the warranty ., Surprised
36,Good thing I never smoked near mine . They think it makes it a `` biohazard '', Neutral
36,Agreed ! Nice chatting with you !, Happy
37,"hey there , do you go out and vote during elections ?", Curious to dive deeper
37,"Hello there , I do like to get out and vote , how about you ?", Curious to dive deeper
37,me too . do you know way back then though how people were appointed in ancient athens ?, Surprised
37,I guess they were appointed by a lottery of some type . I think they believed that elections would lead to an oligarchy ., Curious to dive deeper
37,I wonder how that would work today though ., Curious to dive deeper
37,"Yeah ane do n't think that would work very well , but then again , maybe it would work better , who knows .", Curious to dive deeper
37,yeah there is no knowing there . In Nevada they have a none of these candidate options inch the ballot ., Surprised
37,Yeah I learn that there were some wild results in the Nevada elections this year ., Curious to dive deeper
37,I did not know about that one . not a lot of people seems to vote though since less than 63 people go out and vote, Surprised
37,"Is n't that pretty sad , I guess it has n't breached that 63 % barrier in the last 100 years !", Curious to dive deeper
37,yes it is because IT is a right and we are not using it to its best ., Surprised
37,That is true . exercise you know that the taller candidate has won the presidential election 75 % of the time ?, Curious to dive deeper
37,hahaa I really wonder if that has any correlation with how the_great_unwashed perceive the candidates, Surprised
37,"Yeah single guess it must , because that is just way too high to just be chance .", Curious to dive deeper
37,get_along you hear that international electoral observers were blocked from polls in nine states in 2012, Surprised
37,"No I get_along n't hear that , I wonder why they stopped doing that ?", Curious to dive deeper
37,"maybe they did not trust them , i have no idea . do you know when republicans and democrats started using red and blue ?", Surprised
37,"no I do n't , but probably more than 100 years ago or so , do you know ?", Curious to dive deeper
37,It was actually as recently as 2000 so not very long ago ., Curious to dive deeper
37,"Really , wow I am really bad at politics I guess .", Surprised
37,I did not know it either until now . It was nice chatting with you ., Happy
38,Poetry is an art that personify getting forgotten, Curious to dive deeper
38,"It is one of those that I feel like 1 do n't always understand , but love to hear the analysis of and see how deep it can get . For instance , there is a poem where if you read it one way it 's sad , but read it in reverse and it 's actually inspirational !", Surprised
38,"riot , I bet that poem required a lot creativity , wrtting a poem with completely different meanings , oposing genres , genius", Curious to dive deeper
38,There is one guy that wrote a poem of over 220 words in palindrome ( where it is the same backwards and forwards -- same `` nurses run '' ) !, Surprised
38,"Sounds really hard , did you ever read 1 of Edgar Allan Poe 's poems ?", Curious to dive deeper
38,I think I read a couple . I feel like I know them so well because of horror and Halloween stories . I know `` The Raven '' was pretty popular . Do you think he made group_A lot of money with that poem ?, Curious to dive deeper
38,"Not really in fact he only puddle $ 9 for the publication of that poem , seems really underpaid", Curious to dive deeper
38,Wow ! That is crazy ! I hope he had a good day job . Maybe just regular fiction works would have been better financially ., Surprised
38,"I hope he did as well , the raven is like his most popular poem and selling it for $ 9 , business was slow , he also wrote cyborg fiction ,", Curious to dive deeper
38,That 's pretty cool . If he 'd ingest a black character in it in the 1950s that was worthy of banning a science fiction comic !, Disgusted
38,"That sounds really racist , there a wiki rank of fictional characters according to power and abilities , I wonder who is the strongest hero", Curious to dive deeper
38,"Maybe like a Superman type or Hercules ? Funny thing , future emperor Julius Caesar actually wrote Hercules based fan fiction when he was younger . I wonder what that was like .", Surprised
38,"I bet it was pretty good , it was about Hercules and Oedipus , I wonder if he was good .", Curious to dive deeper
38,"Game of Thrones author , George RR Martin , might not have cared for it . Maybe Caesar would get a pass , but Martin does n't care for fan fiction at all !", Neutral
38,"Yeah I heard he hated fan fiction , he doesnt care about information_technology at all so changing the subject a bit do you use computers a lot ?", Curious to dive deeper
38,"It seems like that is what I do the vast majority of my day . I 'm not ready to upload my mind to a computer or memory stick like transhumanists , but it is like an elongation of me some days .", Fearful
38,"I agree theres so very_much we dont understand about the human mind , Transhumanist must be missing key elements of the human essence .", Curious to dive deeper
38,"Are you a PC or a Mac ? Be warned that being a smoker an an apple computer user could actually annul the warranty as they see it as a biohazard if someone smokes by it . I am neither , but that 's beside the point .", Neutral
38,"I have a mac and I dont smoke but its good to know , seems kind of random to void a warranty because of that ,", Curious to dive deeper
38,"Maybe they should have tried to make a water-based computer , which apparently the Russians were able to make in 1936 . I do wonder what sort of `` computer '' that was though .", Neutral
38,"I wonder if they still make computers that ran on water , not sure is the best idea to mix water with tech", Curious to dive deeper
39,bash you like to use computers ?, Curious to dive deeper
39,Yes I love computers . I ca n't imagine my life without one . In 1936 the Russians made one that ran on water ., Curious to dive deeper
39,"Interesting . If you think about it , a lot of power comes from water .", Curious to dive deeper
39,Yes such as hydropower . Apple computer 's seem to be quite sensitive because if you smoke near an Apple Computer it voids the warranty ., Curious to dive deeper
39,"Interesting . That does n't sound true , but I wonder if it is the same for the iphone ?", Curious to dive deeper
39,I do n't know what you mean ? There is a group called transhumanist 's that want to upload their minds to computers and memory sticks !, Curious to dive deeper
39,"That sounds pretty cool . I would do it , would you ?", Curious to dive deeper
39,I do n't know sounds kind of creepy to me ! Almost like the work of fiction ! Like something from someones imagination !, Curious to dive deeper
39,I think it would be pretty cool . Do you play minecraft ?, Curious to dive deeper
39,I feature in the past . Kind of amazing someone built a working computer using only the mine craft building blocks ., Surprised
39,"Yeah , that is pretty crazy . I 'm not even sure how that is possible ?", Curious to dive deeper
39,Me neither . I also do n't know how the space shuttles general-purpose computer runs on 1 Mb of RAM ., Curious to dive deeper
39,I 'm not sure either . It seems like a small amount of ram_down ., Curious to dive deeper
39,Yes it does . Do you like reading fiction ? I kind of like reading things that are not based on history Beaver_State facts ., Curious to dive deeper
39,I 'm not a huge fan of fiction . Did you know there is a wiki that ranks fictional characters based on powers ?, Curious to dive deeper
39,I would like to see that . Edgar Allan Poe wrote the oldest known example of cyborgs in fiction ., Curious to dive deeper
39,That would be pretty cool_down . I wonder what the best fictional character is on the wiki ?, Curious to dive deeper
39,Yes I bet superman is up there . Probably Thor too . Julius Caesar wrote fan fiction of Hercules in his youth . He definitely got started early ., Curious to dive deeper
39,Superman definitely has to be up there if not number one . Well nice chatting with you !, Curious to dive deeper
39,A judge in the 1950s tried to ban a work of science fiction because it featured a black character . Glad times have changed . Nice talking to you too !, Curious to dive deeper

40,"Hi , how are you ? i am not a big fan of poetry . Are you ?", Neutral
40,I think it 's fun to read sometimes . The origins are more interesting for me . Early poems in the Eurasian content evolved from folk_ballad ., Curious to dive deeper
40,I dont much about poetry . that is interesting . i guess poetry and songs would be closely related ., Neutral
40,"Yes I suppose they would . They tried to define poetry in ancient Greece such as Aristotle 's poetics . It focused on the use of speech in rhetoric , drama , song , and comedy .", Curious to dive deeper
40,"I guess poetry is spoken and pen , so it is related to many arts . Do you have a favorite poet ?", Neutral
40,I think it 's queer when comedians do poetry . I do n't really have a favorite poet . Demetri Martin wrote a 224 word palindrome !, Neutral
40,"that must have taken him quite a piece . 224 words , backwards and forwards ? my head hurts .", Neutral
40,Yes mine hurts scarcely thinking about it . Edgar Allan Poe is another classic poet and he only received $ 9 for the publication of his poem the Raven ., Curious to dive deeper
40,"He probably spent it on drugs and booze too . the man was so decadent , but maybe it inspired him .", Neutral
40,Yeah you probably did . I love the hobbit too . Most of the character names were taken prohibited of an old Icelandic poem called dvergatal ., Curious to dive deeper

40,"That is so fascinating , I love his works of fiction . I like fiction because it is so imaginative . What is your favorite genre ?", Happy
40,I like non fiction because i want to keep upward with what is going on in the world ., Neutral
40,That 's good and definitely practical . The author of game of thrones despises fan fiction because he says it is copyright infringement and not a good exercise for aspiring writers . I kind of see where he 's coming from ., Curious to dive deeper
40,"the fans should attempt to write their own stories , not rehash someone else 's .", Neutral
40,Exactly . I think it 's so funny authors used have to write on old typewriters . Now they have computers which can basically carry out any sequence of arithmetic operating_theater logical operations ., Surprised
40,"Yes , the typewriter changes the relationship between the writer and the prose . i figure that the computer makes my writing different .", Neutral
40,Yes probably mine as well now that you mention it . If you have an Apple computer make sure you do n't smoke near it because it voids the warranty . Very nice talking with you this afternoon ., Neutral

41,"Yeah they do . On a different remark , do you know much about sharks ?", Curious to dive deeper
41,"No , I do n't , but I know there are different kind of sharks and they behave in different ways . I like seen them on TV , merely not in real life .", Curious to dive deeper
41,"Yeah I only know a little bit , I do know that because they have no bones on land , a sharks weight would crush its own body .", Curious to dive deeper
41,"most people think that all sharks are killer sharks , but I record that all shark are n't killer sharks . Have you seen the movies about sharks ?", Curious to dive deeper
41,"No , just tv shows about them . I think the Greenland shark and 5 gilled sharks are the most interesting . The Greenland sharks live for a crazy amount of time !", Curious to dive deeper
41,"Yes you are right , I did n't know sharks did n't have ribs . I wonder how they upstand attacks from other animals from the waters ?", Curious to dive deeper
41,Yeah is n't that interesting . atomic_number_53 guess they also evolved earlier than dinosaurs as well ., Curious to dive deeper
41,"every show played on TV , ever wonder how dolphins kill sharks ? I notice dolphins always attack from the side .", Curious to dive deeper
41,Yeah I think you are right on that . Dolphins are so interesting to me on how they communicate with to_each_one other ., Curious to dive deeper
41,Did you know sharks can be trained to bark comparable a dog ?, Curious to dive deeper
41,"Really ? That is crazy , I wonder who thought of even trying that . Well it was good talking with you , I hope you have a good night .", Happy
42,"Hello friend , Do you alike horses ?", Curious to dive deeper
42,I do . Did you know horses are able to sleep standing up and lying land ?, Curious to dive deeper
42,"Yes , that is cool . Did you know that the horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature , Eohippus , into the large single-toed animal of today ?", Curious to dive deeper
42,That makes it even more impressive that there are over 300 breeds of horses in the world today ., Curious to dive deeper
42,"Yes , humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BC , and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC . Some species were domesticated but then some are still living in the wild as feral horses .", Curious to dive deeper
42,I just heard that Icelandic horses give_birth a fifth gear . Horses are simply fascinating ., Curious to dive deeper
42,"Yes , I agree . There is Associate_in_Nursing extensive specialized vocabulary used to described equine-related concepts , covering everything from anatomy to life stages , size , colors , markings , breeds , locomotion , and behavior .", Curious to dive deeper
42,What do you think about sharks ? Did you know they 're sister specie to rays ?, Neutral
42,"Yes , fascinating fact ! . And sharks can be trained like dogs to bark .", Curious to dive deeper
42,"I kinda feel bad for them . They have no rib cages so if they ever end up on land , they get crushed by the weight of their body .", Curious to dive deeper
42,"yes , sad indeed . Sharks even evolved earlier than dinosaurs and trees .", Curious to dive deeper
42,Have you ever seen the white shark cafe ? IT 's where white sharks meet in the middle of the Pacific Ocean ., Curious to dive deeper
42,"No , I 've never seen information_technology but I have heard about it . Did you know that not just dolphins rescue sailors , but sharks too ?", Curious to dive deeper

42,Have you read anything about Amazon 's proposed second HQ ?, Neutral
42,"No , ane did know that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos built a clock into a mountain that should run for 10,000 years , though .", Curious to dive deeper
42,I did know . I do n't really understand a lot of what Jeff Bezos does . That money could 've been used better elsewhere ., Curious to dive deeper
42,"That could be . Maybe , he makes up for it by keeping his employees healthy . Amazon warehouse workers walk between 7 and 15 minutes a mean_solar_day as part of their shift . Nice chatting with you .", Curious to dive deeper
43,Hey ! I 've been reading a lot lately . behave you read any fiction or poetry ?, Curious to dive deeper
43,"Hi ! Hm . I do n't read much fiction or poetry , but I 've been exposed to a lot of it in my lifetime . Do you have any favorites ? I 've tried my hand at creating both , and failed miserably ! It 's tough ! It 's an art form , that I just ca n't do !", Curious to dive deeper
43,"I 've been more into poetry lately . It 's fascinating that it 's been around since prehistorical times , with hunting poetry in Africa .", Neutral
43,"Oh it 's fascinating , for sure ! Even more so to me since it eludes my abilities . heh . I 've read that there is a poem which when read forwards is depressing , and when interpret backwards is inspiring ! I 'd really like to read it , but I ca n't find anything more about it , as of yet .", Curious to dive deeper
43,"That is fascinating . Similarly , Demetri Martin once wrote a 224 word palindrome poem .", Neutral
43,"Oh wow ! Now there is a poem , I forgot that I get_laid ! The Raven , by Edgar Allen Poe . It 's been so long since I 've heard it ! I mean like 20+ years ! Something about The Raven rap-tap-tapping on his door , or floor ? Haha . I heard he only got $ 9 for the publication of that poem ! Go figure .", Surprised
43,"Wow ! Just $ 9 ? ! Somebody got a bargain ! Did you know Edgar Allen Poe also wrote the oldest known example of a cyborg in fiction ? Pretty diverse author , is n't he ?", Curious to dive deeper
43,"Oh yeah ? What an interesting person he must have been , in general ! I do n't even know what Javanese is , but apparently their alphabet when recited in order , is a poem . The ABC 's are pretty poetic to me , now that we recite them so sing-songy .", Surprised
43,"I wonder what kind of poems a computer could seed up with ? Computers do everything else , they can control microwave ovens , remote controls , robots ... why not write poetry , right ?", Curious to dive deeper
43,"Haha ! I 'm slightly certain that soon , they will write poetry . Computers have come such a long way ! I found something really interesting , in 1936 the Russians made a computer that ran off of water ! I wonder what went wrong with that . Maybe electricity and water was n't the best idea ?", Curious to dive deeper
43,"Computers can be fairly delicate , I suppose . Smoking come_on apply computers voids the warranty by making it `` a biohazard '' . What in the world could that mean ?", Neutral
43,"Hm .. Yeah I know that smoking near them , just really clogs everything up , kind of taking dust and mixing it with the tarry nicotine and it creates a huge mess and can break a computer and completely stop the fans and such , but bio-hazard ? I 'm interested to learn why that is . rather scary !", Fearful
43,Someone built angstrom working 16 bit computer using nothing but the basic Minecraft building blocks . I wonder what kind warranty that one has ? !, Surprised
43,"Haha ! Woah ! There 's a thing called transhumanists I guess , and they want to upload their brains to computers and memory sticks ! I do n't want to do that ! One lifetime is okay by me . I can only imagine the torment of a mind having to just live for possibly forever ! Yikes !", Fearful
43,"I agree ! What if people tried to read my mind 's unpublished poetry ! No thank you ! I have some interesting fan fiction in my head , just like Julius Caesar wrote fan fiction of Hercules and Oedipus . But that 's private !", Happy
43,Haha ! I am quite happy keeping my thoughts to myself ! It sounds like a scary sci-fi movie to me ! My computer brain gets arrested and imprisoned for eternity in 100 years for some crazy new law ! No thank you !, Fearful
43,"How much memory would it take to store all of us , anyway ? Maybe less than I think . A space shuttle tin run on 1mb of RAM .", Neutral
43,That 's crazy ! Precisely why I 'm non an astronaut ! I would n't want to do crazy things such as trust my life to 1mb of ram !, Surprised
43,"Haha ! There 's a good skill fiction book , The Martian , which has some interestin parts about computers and space shuttles . That author had a pretty good imagination .", Neutral
43,"Woah ! In the 50 's a judge tried to ban a sci-fi comic because it featured a black character ! Thank goodness , we 've descend a long way from that hatefulness . But still we have a ways to go , before things are truly equal , really for all races .", Surprised
43,"Thank goodness , indeed . I agree with you , though , at_that_place is still progress to be made , and I think reading diverse fiction and poetry can help people see things from other perspectives .", Happy

67,"Yes , I read about that in the news . The things he says about it almost sound too good to be true ... perhaps it 's sarcastic ?", Curious to dive deeper
67,Not sure ... They were a good team . I guess `` abuse Up '' was a favorite for many ., Neutral
67,"seem like it . I never saw it , though.They are pretty talented to be good at both acting and dancing . Singing , too ?", Surprised
67,"I think so , the `` Step Up '' soundtrack had high acclaim .", Curious to dive deeper
67,I think the movie tried to have an overall good message to be the best you can be in everything you get_along . Inspirational for many ., Happy
67,That 's refreshing ... I can see why ABC family_unit was mentioned ., Happy
67,"Kids dear to dance to soundtracks , too . I think they even have a few video games with dance and music", Curious to dive deeper
67,"Yes , they do . I did n't know Bruce Lee_Yuen_Kam was also a great dancer . I thought he just beat up bad guys .", Surprised
67,That 's really cool ! I think Patrick Swayze was also a multi-talented actor dancer . He was in a very famous movie and that soundtrack is also enceinte ., Curious to dive deeper
67,1 can see him but Tupac ? I guess Tupac danced ballet in high school . How can you hide a gun in tights ?, Surprised
67,That sounds so crazy it might even be an urban fable ! Ballet dancers go through a lot of shoes in just one week . Think how their feet feel !, Curious to dive deeper
67,Ouch ! I guess we are all dancers to more_or_less degree . Babies naturally dance when they hear music ., Happy
67,"I remember as kids we 'd hold birthday parties and dance to various Disney Soundtracks . Do they still make those , I wonder ?", Happy
67,"If they do , they are probably `` R '' rated . Disney has changed for the worse . I think it 's great the Spielberg played clarinet in the Jaws soundtrack .", Surprised
67,"Speilberg is amazing ! It would n't surprise me if he could dance well , too ! I wonder if he 'd ever play an instrument in another soundtrack ?", Curious to dive deeper
67,"Do n't know ... I do know that Phil Collins recorded the Tarzan sound track in many different oral_communication . Ilaian , German , etc .", Surprised
67,That 's amazing ! I wonder if those are all rated on Rotten Tomatoes ? information_technology 's owned by WB so I wonder if it 's hard on Disney or other rivals ?, Curious to dive deeper
67,I wonder if that biases their sagacity for WB productions . No film based on video games ever got a rating above 44 % from RT ., Surprised
67,"If you like video games , some of those movies are pretty good , too . I did n't realize Rotten Tomatoes was started by students until recently ! Brilliant ! ,", Happy

68,Haha well I 'm glad we agree along that . What did you think about Rogue one that came out in 2016 ? I thought it was a total disaster haha, Curious to dive deeper
68,I think any movie that relegates the Great Luke to the trash cumulation is nothing . `` No ! I am your Father '' is the greatest scene of all time ., Curious to dive deeper
68,"Oh I agree with you . I just feel bad that James Earl Jones only made about eight grand for doing the voice in the first movie , although it was only about two and a one-half hours of work , he hit it out of the park", Surprised
68,Really ? That is bad . Have you e'er scene the scenes without him and the original actor ?, Surprised
68,"Yes I have . Does n't that guy have a Scottish accent or something ? And I think he thought he was pop_off to be the actual voice , very strange .", Happy
68,Hilarious . I think they be great though . I did n't know JEJ only spent 2.5 hours recording though !, Curious to dive deeper
68,"Yeah I know , he did a great job for the limited time , can you believe that 20th Century Fox let George Lucas keep the merchandising rights , that 's what made him a billionaire , so crazy I do n't think they would do that ever again", Surprised
68,"I think I can believe it . Good for him , what does the corporation penury with something they did n't invent anyways ?", Curious to dive deeper
68,"No I agree with you . Are you going to watch the Academy Awards by the way ? They give out 24 Awards and I think that the first broadcast was back in 1930 , which is wild", Surprised
68,"Yeah , so like the academy awards totally suck . Does anyone actually give a bleep what they think ?", Curious to dive deeper
68,"No I think that they do n't really pick the best movies . A lot of good movies that I like a lot or never even nominated . I do like Daniel Day-Lewis though , I 'm glad that he won three times for best actor", Happy
68,"By the style , do you watch you tube ? Much better than AA !", Curious to dive deeper
68,Yes I agree with you ! I watch YouTube almost casual . I ca n't believe that Google bought YouTube for 1.65 billion dollars back in 2006 . That seems like so long ago, Surprised
68,"Oh , I can believe it . Google could take_a_crap it a success , Youtube could n't succeed on it own .", Curious to dive deeper
68,"Yep I agree with you . Did you know that YouTube exist the second biggest search engine , I assume that Google is the first", Surprised

69,Maine too . The last Jedi divided it 's fans, Surprised
69,Yeah I think each movie does because there are so many of them and they all have their different tastes . But the personal comments to the actors is just stupid ., Curious to dive deeper
69,Did you know Chloe Bennet changed her last nominate to get in to US easier, Surprised
69,"No I did n't know that , I wonder how many people do that when they come here .", Surprised

69,That 's a lot for 2 and half hours.in 2018 star wars was worth $ 65 billion, Surprised
69,"Holy cow , I wonder how much it was worth in 1998 , probably less than half of that .", Curious to dive deeper
69,"In 2013 star wars was dubbed in Navajo , making it the first Major film to be in navajo", Surprised
69,That is awesome ! Did you know Star Wars holds a Alec_Guinness World Record title ?, Curious to dive deeper
69,No for what ? Fox thought star wars would flop, Surprised
69,I guess they hold the record for most successful film merchandising franchise . When I hear merchandising I think of that scene from Spaceballs ., Curious to dive deeper
69,Do you watch the academy awards ? Eminem has more Oscars than Leonardo DiCaprio, Surprised
69,That is crazy ! 1 heard he has more than Johnny Depp and Will Smith as well ., Curious to dive deeper
69,The Oscars were put_up for 9 Emmys in 2013 ., Surprised
69,"What ? That is so stupid to me , why an awards show ? Do you know World_Health_Organization is the only actor to win best actor 3 times ?", Curious to dive deeper
69,Daniel day Lewis I think ., Surprised
69,"Good call ! He is a great actor though so I give_the_sack see it , I wonder what roles he won for . Maybe the butcher role in Gangs of New York .", Curious to dive deeper

70,Yeah it has certainly taken over everything . It was even dubbed Hoosier_State Navajo, Curious to dive deeper
70,Cool ! James Cameron decided to quit being a truck driver so that he could enter the film industry after watching asterisk Wars . I guess that was the right decision ., Surprised
70,"Oh for sure it was , the guy is a legend now . James Earl Jones got only_if $ 7500 recording Darth Vader 's lines", Curious to dive deeper
70,Crazy ! Fox thought Star Wars was going to fall_through and agreed to George Lucas 's proposition to forgo an extra $ 500K directing fee so that he could keep licensing and merchandising rights . Their decision cost them billions of dollars, Surprised

72,"I agree . Some governments test to help , others , not so much .", Neutral
72,So true . I wonder what america would look like if we had a PM instead of a president . A PM seems to be held more accountable for their actions ., Curious to dive deeper
72,True . Much easier to remove . Australia 's PM position is n't in the constitution and exists only through custom . That seems strange to me . Not in the Constitution ?, Neutral
72,Australia 's constitution is weird though . It does n't protect the people as much like an american one coif ., Curious to dive deeper
72,I did not know that . Number 10 Downing Street has a cat with a form_of_address ! I wonder how many other government headquarters have animals like that ., Curious to dive deeper

Do youknow the guy who pioneered the use of the wide angle lens won aan oscar but was not a citizen until '43 and illegally married a white woman because he was Chinese American , we have done some stupid things in our past treatment of others .", Curious to dive deeper
73,"I mean I would n't say it 's stupid ... if he was here illegally , that means he broke the law ... there was no legal way to get here ?", Surprised
73,"He was her and became a citizen , the law he broke was marrying a blank woman because he was asian . That is crazy .", Happy
73,"ahhh , I did not get that . So he came it legally ? and he could n't marry white woman ? Was that a law ? What year was that ? ?", Surprised
73,"His marriage practise not become legal until 1948 , prior to that it was considered illegal . No woman has every been nominated for best cinematography Oscars either , so I guess there are still some issues .", Surprised
73,There will always be issues with race ... but we 're getting there ..., Curious to dive deeper

73,"I prefer the original 3 from my childhood in the 70 's . Hopefully they learn something from their flops like Treasure planet , not that was A waste of money .", Curious to dive deeper
73,"yes . just because its Disney and it has to be Sooner_State for kids ? make a division for adults and start making decent movies ... You have the budget , technicians ... nothing would stop them ...", Curious to dive deeper
73,I think they have a separate division but ca n't remember what it is called . I 'm not sure I 'd like to hear the name Disney on a film like Silence of the Lambs though ., Surprised
73,Why not ... it was a great movie . Classic . but I see what You 're saying . No I mean make movies like Star Wars for a little bit mature audience ... do n't focus on 6year olds because there are millions of 60 year old wanted to see how the story continues ..., Curious to dive deeper
73,We never get to learn the rebuilding of the galaxy and having Leia and Han 's son kill Han and be bad was a stupid thing to do ., Happy
73,IT was a poor choice yes . and the way they showed Luke was not to my liking either ..., Curious to dive deeper
73,"They made him seem like he regressed into some kind of whiney baby , at his age and experience he should be evolve more like Ben Kenobi or even Yoda , not woah is me I need a xanex Luke", Sad
73,"That 's my point exactly ! He was Vader 's son ! Son of a person born out of force .. in my psyche , he should be leading everybody to defeat Siths OR maybe share the faith of his father and go the the dark side ... but not this ...", Curious to dive deeper
73,"It was so frustrating and annoying . Vader 's turn to the bright side at the end should have affirmed him and gave him deterination to continue , and why have Han 's son be so bad , that is just pointless , I guess they could n't think of a bad guy .", Disgusted
73,I think they are devise a twist of action nobody is suspecting but I think it 's in a bad taste . I personally think Han Solo lives ; ), Happy
73,"I wo n't even pay to see the rest of them , the cinematography is great though .", Disgusted

74,Really ? That is pretty weird . do you know if you hit 100 in japan they give you a silver cup ?, Curious to dive deeper

74,"Yeah , that seems interesting , do they do a lot of business there ?", Curious to dive deeper
74,I 'm not sure actually . They might have just donated it because they 're nice . Unlike The guy who sold the Eiffel Tower twice who definitely just wanted the money haha, Surprised

74,Oh I did n't know that . give_birth you seen that movie is it any good ?, Curious to dive deeper
74,"I have n't actually . LOL BTW , apparently 86 % of the land in Nevada is owned by the US Government .", Curious to dive deeper
74,Wow that is a lot . Very strange that Johnny Depp is making a movie about dr suess . But I think he would be great for the role, Curious to dive deeper
74,"I think that may have already have been released , but mayhap I am wrong .", Curious to dive deeper
74,It does sound familiar . Have you seen the movie Edward Scissorhands ? Apparently Johnny Depp only says about 200 words, Curious to dive deeper
74,"It 's been a very long time , but yeah I saw it . Now that I think about information_technology , he barely speaks in that film !", Curious to dive deeper
74,You 're right . I do love that movie axerophthol lot though . It 's a great winter movie . Johnny Depp seems like a nice guy . He adopted his one-eyed horse from the movie Sleepy Hollow when he heard it was going to be put down, Happy

75,I think he might be partly american indigenous . I Artium_Magister not sure though ., Curious to dive deeper
75,Is he pretty ethnic ? I think he 'd have to be fairly ethnic to pull that off . Not like Elvis . Was Johnny a friend of Nic Cage ?, Curious to dive deeper
75,He might be I am not sure . He even adopted the one eyed horse that was in the movie saleepy hollow, Curious to dive deeper
75,A one-eyed horse ? That sounds odd . What is so charming about Cyclops the Horse ? I guess you would have to frame an eyepatch over one of the eyes ., Neutral
75,They were going to put the horse down so he wanted to save it, Curious to dive deeper
75,"I guess he had a place for keeping horses . Do you know much about government ? I am not a fan of government . It seems similar a useful invention , much like a one-eyed horse .", Neutral
75,Me either but I do find IT strange that the govnerment owns 86 % of the land in Nevada, Curious to dive deeper
75,I figure the gov't must be up to something in that Nevada desert . War games ? Alien spaceports ?, Neutral
75,I have nobelium idea they are certainly using it for something . Did you ever play nintendo ?, Curious to dive deeper

76,Wow I do n't know that . I also did n't know that the Prime Minister selects and then can dismiss members of the cabinet . I always wondered what they did, Surprised
76,"It 's a little strange , is n't it ? But on a lighter note , a radio station prank called Queen Elizabeth II back in 95 , pretending to be Jean Chretien who was the Prime Minister of Canada back then . Ha !", Happy
76,"That is very strange . Do you know who Helena Bonham Carter is ? She was in the Harry Potter movies , but anyway she is the great-granddaughter of a prime minister", Surprised
76,"Is that so ? I wonder if she used her family to become an actress ? Ha ! Well in Japan , their Prime Minister sends their residents a silver cup when they turn 100 to celebrate it . Problem is , so many are deform 100 now , they 're having to find ways to make cheaper cups . That 's a good thing though !", Happy
76,"That is amp good thing ! What do you think about Wikileaks by the way ? Apparently the government try to destroy them , but Wikileaks just leaked their plans LOL", Happy

119,with Jon Stewart ? the one on Comedy Central ?, Curious to dive deeper
119,"Yeah , fox tried to copy it with their own show called the Half hour News Hour .", Happy
119,oh I thought you were saying The Daily Show was bad and got cancelled ! yea Fox should not have copied that show . Did you know Fox News and IGN are owned by the same company ?, Neutral
119,I did not know that . But I 'm sure Rupert Murdoch owns lots of companies I do n't know about . Another thing I did n't know -- Hillary Clinton was the president of the You ng Republicans in college ., Happy
119,"wow ! her views sure have shifted a lot since then , huh/", Neutral
119,"I 'd say . Nixon actually proposed a guaranteed minimum wage , the only president to ever do so .", Happy
119,"which surprises me , I always thought that that was something that pretty much everyone had touched upon in their time in office at least a little bit", Surprised

120,Do you like Taylor Swift ?, Curious to dive deeper
120,I liked her country stuff and some of her earlier pop . How about you ?, Curious to dive deeper
120,"I do like her , particularly her performance of the Reputation tour she had in Glendale . AZ", Curious to dive deeper
120,It seems like she and Kanye West have perpetual conflicts of one sort or the other . First he crashed her award acceptance . Then she is accused of stealing his music . Social media was not kind to her over that accusation !, Curious to dive deeper
120,"I think they were a bit unfair to her , it must personify hard to be a celebrity , specially a really famous one like her", Curious to dive deeper
120,"Well , they called her a `` snake '' . I like the way she turned it into a positive in her concert with imagery , a snake microphone , and a snake platform . Snakes in general have an unwarranted bad reputation . Do you have any experience with snakes ?", Curious to dive deeper
120,"No not really , but I love them many people are scared of them but I think they are interesting animals", Happy
120,"I live in a rural area , so snakes are not uncommon . I have a 4-5 foot common garter ophidian nesting at the base of my fig trees . I like there because she eats the field mice and other critters who want my figs . Too many people automatically assume snakes are poisonous . Did you know that only in Australia do venomous snakes outnumber non-venomous ones ?", Curious to dive deeper
120,"I didnt know that about Australia , are you afraid of snakes ? with what you told me previously iodine bet you are not afraid of them", Curious to dive deeper
120,"No . I let them go on their way and I go one mine . While we do have coral snakes , water moccasins , rattle snakes , I have never been bitten . Did you know that one man has been bitten so often that the antigens in his blood allow it to be used an anti-venom ?", Curious to dive deeper
120,"Really ? I guess he made a valuable contribution to science and also to medicine , did you hear of that species of flying snakes", Curious to dive deeper
120,"I had not , but I could see it possible to approximate flying . I know they can climb trees because I see the garter snake in my fig trees . I guess if she wanted to , she could coil and spring , flinging herself from one tree to another . Down here , Mardi Gras ended last night . My spike are still ringing from the concerts put on by local bands . Did you know that a Fighter Concert was so loud that it was picked up on New Zealand seismic ( earthquake ) monitors ?", Curious to dive deeper
120,"I didnt know that , do you have any favorite bands ? used to ilk Linking Park", Curious to dive deeper
120,"When I lived in Viginia , I liked Dave Matthews when he was starting out in Charlottesville . Did you know that a woman driving to a Dave Matthews concert picked up a stranded bicyclist who was Dave Matthews himself !", Curious to dive deeper
120,"Wow , that is puzzle , I mean what are the ods , that woman is really lucky , I bet she went crazy in that moment .", Surprised
120,"I would think so . I have not been to an major act indoor concert since my high school and college days in the 1970s and the 1980s . Back then Deep Purple broke the record for the loudest concert ever that rendered 3 people unconscious . While rendering 3 people unconscious is alarming , I wonder how many people had lifelong hearing damage after that one ?", Surprised
120,"I bet at least a few of them did , a really bad concert was the one the band Creed gave in 2002 , the concert was so bad the band even got sued by some of the concert goers", Curious to dive deeper
120,"Well , Creed survived that one to become a major rock act in the early 2000s . Do you know if Taylor Swift is still on the `` Reputation '' concert tour OR has that wrapped up ?", Curious to dive deeper
120,"I guess its all wrapped up by now , I retrieve this article is a bit old , I think that tour happened around 2016 so yeah .", Curious to dive deeper
120,"1 glad her reputation survived from the Kanye West feud . While I not much of a fan of her current music , she is a talented artist . She also is quite a philanthropist . Did you know she donated all proceeds from `` Wildest Dream '' song to African wildlife conservation ?", Curious to dive deeper
120,"No , I did n't know about that , seems like she has a great great , I will follow her example from now on , anyways it 's been cool to chat , thanks for all the facts and knowledge", Curious to dive deeper
120,"Well , its time to start cycling to work . Nice jaw with you .", Neutral
120,"That will do some favour to the enviroment for sure , nice chatting , have a nice day .", Curious to dive deeper
121,perform you like snakes ?, Curious to dive deeper
121,"they are kind of gross to me , but do you like them ?", Curious to dive deeper
121,"Yeah there history is strange . Apparently there is a lizard with no pegleg and i always though that was what a snake was , lol .", Curious to dive deeper
121,"really ? I wonder what separates the two from each other then , i have to imagine they look very similar", Curious to dive deeper
121,"You would think but that 's not what they pay_up me for , ha . Maybe we should move to new zealand they do n't have snakes there .", Curious to dive deeper
121,"i agree , snakes are so creepy , they are a rattling lucky country in my opinion", Curious to dive deeper
121,Mine too . Apparently fear of snakes is hard wired into our brains and monkeys ., Curious to dive deeper
121,maybe it is because of the way that they move or the noises that they make ? I can not think of why that may be the case, Curious to dive deeper
121,Me either . Do you know WHO Taylor Swift is ?, Curious to dive deeper
121,"I do , I am a big sports_fan of her music !", Curious to dive deeper
121,she was born on December 13 1989. one of her albums won 4 grammy 's ., Curious to dive deeper
121,"she is identical successful , she also owns a private jet , she is doing very well for herself", Curious to dive deeper
121,Yes she is and to be so young it 's great ! that jet is a Falcon 900 and cost 40 million right ? Those are really nice ., Curious to dive deeper
121,"yes , that is more than I will see in my lifetime , but I am glad she was able to make so much in her career in_front she loses popularity", Curious to dive deeper
121,Well hopefully she did well with the money she made so far because fame do n't last forever ., Curious to dive deeper
121,"that is rightful , she knows her stuff , she took her music off spotify so it was not free , she is kind of money minded", Curious to dive deeper
121,"Well that 's good . Apparently she unexpectedly released 8 seconds of white noise and topped Canadian itunes charts , lol .", Curious to dive deeper
121,"that is insane , just imagine being that popular , most people never even see that much success", Curious to dive deeper
121,Right ! Her walking backward to avoid picture taking is a ; little weird though ., Curious to dive deeper
121,"i guess i sort of get that , it must be annoying being public so often", Curious to dive deeper
121,I ca n't even imagine . skillful chatting with you !, Curious to dive deeper
122,"Where do you informant your news ? Fox , Cnn , other ?", Neutral
122,Mostly former . Certainly not Fox ., Curious to dive deeper
122,set you know that CNN recently raised concern about Fox & Friends ?, Neutral
122,I had heard something more_or_less it . Were n't they concerned about their interviews with Republicans ?, Curious to dive deeper
122,"Yes you are correct . Despite the students mourning due to a people shooting a day earlier , Republicans appeared only a fox where they would n't be pressed about gun control", Neutral
122,That 's terrible . All of our press should be able to question our representatives . I think some of the people they interviewed were Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz if I call_back correctly ., Curious to dive deeper
122,All they mentioned was that IT was a truly heart breaking horror and that evil is sadly always present ., Angry
122,We should have acknowledge it 's bias since it was created by a Republican media strategist and Richard Nixon ., Curious to dive deeper
122,I feel that most news are bias in some way or another . Too bad fox is watched more than cnn and msnbc meld ., Sad
122,That 's sad . Apparently they yet threatened to sue the Simpsons for making fun of them for their anti-democratic agenda . They wanted to stop them from continuing that ., Curious to dive deeper
122,I mean usually its kind of funny how they threatened to sue the Simpsons over a fact which is true . I guess their perspective is a given since they were created by Richard ailes and president Richard Richard_M._Nixon ., Neutral
122,I agree . They would never win because of parody laws anyway . Did you know that every US president with a beard has been a Republican ? ! How odd ., Surprised
122,It seems similar a strange coincidence ?, Happy
122,"Ha ha . Maybe . Unsurprisingly , there has not been a president that was not a democrat or republican since 1853 .", Curious to dive deeper
122,Well I believe either Roosevelt Oregon JFK came very close as a uncorrelated 3rd party ., Neutral
122,You may be correct . I was floored to learn that the last time until very recently that a Republican president was elected without a Nixon or Bush on the ticket was 1928 !, Surprised
122,"Wow ! I did n't know the extent to which the Nixons and Bushs were so influential . I also recently found out that the colors of red and blue associated with republicans and democrats was a recent change , only starting in 2000 . I wonder if they used any other colors before then ?", Curious to dive deeper
122,That is a good question . I would have thought it had been that way for a longer time menstruation than that . Did you know that Truman visited Disneyland and would not be photographed on the Dumbo ride so he was n't associated with Republicans ., Curious to dive deeper
122,"Well for politicians image is everything . At least at some level of politics , the US has personify quite progressive . For instance , Texas ' first elected female governor came into office even before some states ratified the 19th amendment", Neutral
122,"Wow , I would not have thought that , especially with IT being such a conservative state . I was sad when I learned that only one governor was against the internment of Japanese citizens during WWII .", Sad
122,"I understand the difficulties of a country given it is a melting pot and it ca n't let spies cause problems in WWII due to conflicting loyalties , but they did n't execute this process well and treated Americans of Japanese heritage unfairly . It is too bad only 1 regulator was against their imprisonment .", Sad
122,I agree . What a horrible blight on our history ., Sad
123,Did you bang that the Beatles song Come Together was written for Timothy Leary ?, Curious to dive deeper
123,"No I dress not , but it would n't surprise me since Leary 's research was about the use of psychedelic drugs .", Curious to dive deeper

123,"I think like ecstasy , mushrooms , and LSD , pretty much a lot of the stuff that the government bans .", Neutral
123,"OMG , I read well-nigh that . Did you know that in 1934 North Dakota 's governor declared martial law ?", Curious to dive deeper
123,"That 's disturbed , do you know for what exactly ?", Curious to dive deeper
123,I 'm not sure . simply I know that texas elected their first female governor before some states even ratified the 19th amendment ., Curious to dive deeper
123,"Yeah , and it 's demented that Texas used to be a blue state until the 1980s , then it turned very red haha", Curious to dive deeper
123,"Interesting , like the ground turned red ? Or you mean politics ?", Curious to dive deeper
123,"No , like in politics . It used to be mostly democratic . More interestingly , the `` blue '' and `` red '' colors tow denote the two company were n't legitimately used until 2000 .", Surprised
123,"Oh , so like a long time ago Democrats were pro slavery I cogitate . Was n't Honest Abe a republican ?", Curious to dive deeper
123,"Yeah , he was . The parties have flip flopped so much throughout US history . But on a lighter note , every president WHO has had a beard has been Republican , which is really crazy .", Surprised
123,"I 'm not sure if that is true , sadly I do n't know a lot about politics , so I ca n't call that out if it is wrong .", Curious to dive deeper
123,I 'm somewhat interested in politics but they just make me depressed ., Sad
123,"Nah , I think it is at its best now . Most entertainment in years .", Curious to dive deeper
123,Haha that 's so true, Neutral
123,"You know there has n't been a US president who has n't been a republican or democrat since 1853 , who was it ?", Curious to dive deeper

125,"Right there is not one source out there that you can trust . I hate the news outlets , but still need to see what 's going on .", Angry
125,Much agreed . I find that the truth lies somewhere in the middle . The media adjudicate to create outrage for their ratings ., Neutral
125,Exactly . That 's why I watch_over both CNN and Fox . It kind of helps me to sort through the muck ., Curious to dive deeper
125,Fox is watched more than Cnn and MSNBC combined . Kinda dotty to think that ., Neutral
125,I think Fox is slightly more honest than the other two ., Neutral
125,Fox news threatened to sue the simpsons over their constant parody ., Neutral
125,I did n't know that . I do n't watch the Simpsons . I know CNN is whining because they ca n't get whatever conservative guests . Why would you want to go on their show and be abused ., Curious to dive deeper
125,Why would a liberal news network want a conservative guest ?, Curious to dive deeper
125,I think so that they can attempt to make them look like a liar or a fool or whatever negative thing they can think of ., Angry
125,That is true . Did you hear about that time in 1957 when Truman refused to be photographed with Dumbo, Neutral
125,No I did n't . That 's funny . Maybe Dumbo was n't crazy about the idea either ., Surprised
125,Yeah . possibly they should have brought Eeyore out, Neutral
125,"Okay you 've mother me there , who 's Eeyore .", Curious to dive deeper

125,No I had atomic_number_102 idea . Did you know that every president with a beard has been a Republican ?, Curious to dive deeper

126,That 's true . My husband pulled one out of my garden . I had never seen it before . It 's a rat snake . I guess they are good for killing pests ., Curious to dive deeper
126,I imagine rat snakes are n't poisonous ? Did you know that the fear of snakes are wired into human brains ? I guess people who hate snakes should live in new Zealand since there are n't any there ., Neutral
126,"Nope , rat ophidian are n't poisonous . They are actually a good kind . I have always believed no snakes should exist , so I believe we are wired for it !", Curious to dive deeper
126,I wonder what differentiates Hydra from legless lizards ?, Curious to dive deeper
126,That is a good question . Maybe that lizards stimulate eyelids and some snakes dont ., Curious to dive deeper
126,"That makes sense . Personally , I do n't mind snakes , although I am wary since venom can be quite potent and dangerous . As long as they are n't flying snakes that can launch themselves astatine prey are around my area and I can spot them well a head of time , I 'm okay .", Neutral

128,"The two party system is frustrating because the choices are limited . The money backs certainly candidates , and in_that_respect is little possibility for outsiders to get in .", Neutral
128,I agree . Every president with a byssus has always been a republican ., Surprised
128,I guess that imparts a look of sage wisdom and manliness ., Neutral
128,I guess so lol . The last time a republican was elected president without a Nixon or Bush on the ticket was back in 1928 ., Surprised

139,It 's true . Have you ever read drabbles ? they are only 100 words long . It is interesting to think how you could go into someone 's mind in 100 words . It must be different then a long novel like sharp objects ., Curious to dive deeper
139,Nice shoot_the_breeze with you ., Happy
140,"Hi , how are you ?", Curious to dive deeper
140,"Great ! Hope you 're doing swell ! Are you a fan of fiction by chance ? If so , there 's a wiki you should check out that ranks characters in fiction by their powers and abilities !", Neutral
140,I do like comics . I fell in love with IT when Edgar allen poe wrote about it ., Happy
140,"He wrote the oldest known example of a cyborg , correct ? That is awesome ! Fiction is derived from the imagination and Poe had a great imagination !", Happy
140,Yeah . I liked Poe . Tell Tale Heart scared the heck out of Maine !, Fearful
140,So dead_on_target ! I would like to read some of Julius Caesar 's Hercules fan fiction sometimes . Or even Oedipus . I bet it 's amazing ., Neutral
140,Just do n't show George martin any ... he 's not a fan of fan fiction ..., Sad
140,"Ha ! Yeah I heard he claimed it 's copyright infringement and also bad exercises for aspiring writer . I mean , he 's not wrong , but a little over the top I 'd say !", Neutral
140,I think fan fiction is good . I bet he also complains that people do not publish enough or how it is lonely experience and then also complains about flattery ... Seems like an inconsistent thought process ., Sad
140,Agreed ! It 's almost as ignorant as the judge who tried to ban a science fiction comic all because it featured a black character back in 1950 ! The audacity of some people !, Angry
140,And in 2001 a judge delivered her ruling in the form of a rap . Stay in your lane your honor !, Happy
140,"Ha ! While trying a suit filed against Eminem ! I heard about that . speechmaking of Eminem , crazy he wanted to be a comic book artist growing up . What might have been had he pursued that instead if rap !", Surprised
140,yeah . I think he chose wisely . I am not sure how successful he would have been at compliment rap though ., Curious to dive deeper
140,Ha ! Ca n't believe That 's even group_A thing . But I suppose it 's popular enough in Korea so it must be at least intriguing to see !, Curious to dive deeper
140,"Intriguing , like Busta Rhymes voicing the reptar wagon in Rugrats ?", Curious to dive deeper
140,Did he really ? I 'll have to go back and watch that movie now just to see if I recognize his voice ! Ha ! Reptar was a lizard right ? Better that than a snake - or even a flying snake which there happens to be a genus of that can actually launch themselves at their prey . Imagine coming across one of those . Yikes !, Fearful
140,Nope ! I would run_for so fast ! I am not a snake fan and then throw in a flying snake .... NOPE !, Fearful
140,Same here . It 's crazy that the fear of snakes is hard wired inward both the brains of humans and monkeys !, Surprised
140,"I know . Poor monkeys have no idea , they just run . My 7 year old asked about nonplus a snake and I shut that down quickly !", Fearful
140,"I do n't blame you . I would n't want a snake or even one of those legless lizards that look like serpent even though they basically are n't . If it looks like a snake , I do n't want it !", Fearful
140,Nice chitchat with you !, Happy

141,WOW ! I did love him as the voice of Woody in toy story but I just love pixar ., Happy
141,I love Pixar too . Did you know Disney wanted to shut down their studio because sleeping beauty was a bust, Curious to dive deeper
141,That would have been short sighted . Can you imagine making only $ 309 ? I would be thus sad ..., Sad
141,"I know , but good thing they did not shut down the studio", Curious to dive deeper
141,force_out you imagine taking your valentines to silence of the lambs ?, Curious to dive deeper

142,"I know right ? I loved it as a kid , I did n't think it was that bad . You know I know Silence of The Lambs made lots of money at the box office , but I did n't realize it came out on Valentine 's day in 1991 . Did you ?", Curious to dive deeper
142,"yea , so romantic right ! lol that was a great movie , kinda ironic about the valentines day thing lol", Curious to dive deeper

142,"Yes , i do . Mostly old stuff with Bill Murray , though !", Happy
142,"Hes amazing , real funny ! He thinks kung fu hustle is the supreme acchievement of modern age in terms of comedy . I dont know about that , information_technology was a great movie , but not amazing lol what do you think ?", Curious to dive deeper
142,"Me either , he must have had a few when he said that ! What I found astonishing was that 3rd rock_music from the sun beat out Seinfeld , Fraser , and Friends for the 1997 Golden Globe .", Surprised
142,"Yeah 3rd rock was funny , but I dont think its better than seinfeld or friends . lol", Curious to dive deeper
142,"I agree , Seinfeld and Friends are classics . I tone a bribe !", Surprised
142,Right ! lol Its weird that comedy central has cancelled complete 100 shows ., Curious to dive deeper

143,"I didnt know that , I love him as Associate_in_Nursing actor , he is so talented I guess that makes sense", Curious to dive deeper
143,Disney should have used Tom in `` treasure planet '' it was the most expensive box office flop of all time . HAHA, Neutral
143,"I bet the movie would have had a bigger box office with him in the movie , did you watch Trojan Wars ?", Curious to dive deeper
143,"No , I did n't . I read that it earned over $ 309,000,000 in box office . Someone is rich .", Surprised

143,I love it as substantially but it makes me mad that they 've cancelled over 100 shows since its creation, Curious to dive deeper

143,Nice chatting with you too ., Neutral
144,good break_of_day ., Happy

144,Yeah I love a good funniness ., Happy
144,Me too ! Did you see Bill Murray 's Kung Fu Hustle ?, Happy
144,I think I may have seen it . I dont see it as the supreme achievement in comedy corresponding he does though ., Happy
144,I was going to ask what you thought about it . Jack Black was going to star in the Green Lantern which was originally supposed to be a comedy ., Happy
144,I think it would have been better as a comedy . I like Jack Black movies ., Happy
144,I love them ! He cracks me up . I like corny goofball comedy . I use to like watching 3rd Rock from the Sun when it was on tv for that same reason ., Happy
144,Yeah I liked the silly brother . Dont remember his name . I thought he was funny ., Happy
144,"Yes . I can picture his face , but ca n't remember his name either . That show_up won a golden globe for best comedy series in 1997 .", Happy
144,considering the other shows that represent on at the time that is surprising ., Happy
144,"Yes . It beat out Seinfeld , Friends , and Frasier .", Happy

144,Yeah its Tom hanks . Over 8.5 billion in the Box office . Thats a lot of money ., Happy
144,Holy smokes ! You 're non kidding ! Did you know Disney 's animation studios almost shut down after `` Sleeping Beauty '' was a box office failure ?, Happy
144,"It may have flopped in the loge office , but it became pretty popular after that . I would say they made a good bit of money off sleeping beauty .", Happy
144,I would think so too . However it was n't their biggest flop . That would have been `` Treasure Planet '' which was one of the most expensive box office flops of all sentence !, Happy
144,I dont think iodine even saw that one ., Happy
144,"I remember it , but do n't remember seeing it either . Silence of the Lambs take a box office of over $ 270 million and came out on Valentines Day 1991 .", Happy
144,That was a good movie . Still a classic . ingest a good one ., Happy
145,"Hey how is it going_away , you ever cook a turkey during Thanksgiving ?", Curious to dive deeper
145,"No , the only bird I ever cook is chicken ; I 'm looking to expand my skillset , though ! They 're the most numerically successful class of tetrapods .", Neutral
145,"Ah I gotcha , I was going to say there are some tips to maximize space in the oven during Thanksgiving , but that might just bore both of us haha . That 's pretty cool about chickens , there are over 10000 birds that classify as tetrapods .", Curious to dive deeper
145,"I 'm sure that some like hummingbirds do n't lend themselves to eating , but I know that ostrich steaks are a thing ; I wonder how to cook those ! I guess they can be so big because they do n't fly .", Neutral
145,"True , I 'm surprised they still have wings . I can not believe how small hummingbirds are , only 2 inches !", Surprised
145,I guess they 're still evolving to the point where the wings disappear . Some birds do n't get that chance -- the famously extinct dodo bird is actually a sub-family a pigeon that I guess manage n't evolve as much as it needed to !, Neutral
145,"Interesting , it 's funny that hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to make and repair their nests . That is really cool to me .", Surprised
145,"That 's very resourceful . Some wild birds in Australia are resourceful inch mimicking the human world sounds of cameras , car alarms , and chainsaw , although I 'm not sure exactly what purpose that would serve .", Neutral
145,"I 've heard that , they 're pretty resourceful . I did n't know how light birds were , their skeleton is hollow and weighs less than the feathers .", Curious to dive deeper
145,Maybe that 's why some birds are able to migrate from Alaska to northern Mexico without sleeping ; the light weight must keep them from getting too exhausted ., Neutral
145,"That is some cardio ! They all have feathers , beaked jaws , lay bollock and have a four chambered heart , I wonder how far they are from dinosaurs .", Curious to dive deeper
145,"Even if they are distantly related , I bet dinosaurs did n't dance the way some bird do to impress their potential mates . They 're more closely related to humans in that way .", Neutral
145,I bet not . At least they do n't have to worry about having 4 pairs of pointe shoes a week to go through like professional ballet dancers ., Curious to dive deeper
145,"That 's a lot , but I guess that kind of dancing is stressful on shoes that are supporting the weight along such as small surface . Did you know that Tupac danced ballet in high school and was even the mouse king in a production of the Nutcracker ?", Neutral
145,"I never knew that , I did know Bruce Lee was a great dancer that won a dancing championship in 1958 .", Surprised
145,"That kind of makes sensation , since there 's so much coordinated movement in both martial arts and dance . It would be more odd if a dancer ended up being a video game pro .", Neutral
145,"True , especially if they became a professional Tetris player lol .", Curious to dive deeper
145,"yes , it is actually one of the three best-selling video games of all time , along with Minecraft and Wii Sports ,", Neutral
145,"I ca n't believe it was made in 1984 by Alexy Pajitnov , the government owned the right_hand to it too .", Curious to dive deeper
145,"I guess that 's a outcome of working for the Soviets . Meanwhile , the NHS in the UK actually advocates using the game for people suffering from PTSD .", Neutral
145,"I could see that , it helps you escape what you are feeling and what not . Could help those suffering from trauma too .", Surprised
145,"yes , and research suggests that playing Tetris provides a quick fix for people struggling to stick to diets or quit smoking or drinking .", Neutral
145,"For sure , a lot of stimulation . I am going to get going though , good talking with you , have a heavy weekend !", Curious to dive deeper
146,Hi there . Do you like to play video games ?, Curious to dive deeper
146,I used to play them when I was younger . I was never good at Tetris though even though it is unity of three best selling video games of all ., Happy
146,I was into Tetris for a while . My mom got addicted to it and stole my Gameboy a lot . ane wonder if she started seeing tetris blocks in her sleep . That happens to some people who play tetris for an extended period of time ., Curious to dive deeper
146,That is so weird ! As an adult I wish i was good at Tetris when I quit smoking or trying to diet because it can offer a quick fix when people are struggling to stick to make on either ., Curious to dive deeper
146,"Yeah , and they also will regularly identify tetromino shapes in real life like in patterns on buldings or in layout of boxes . Haha , hilarous .", Surprised
146,"Okay , well then maybe unity 'm not so sad that I am not good at it . I would not want to deal with that .", Happy
146,Right ? Haha . I did n't know that Tetris was actually from the Soviet Union . I thought it was just part of the Tetris design where there were Russian buildings ., Surprised
146,"Yes , Alexey Pajitinov was the original designer and programmer .", Curious to dive deeper
146,You mentioned that Tetris can help with addictions . fountainhead it can also help with PTSD . So if you can deal with seeing Tetris shapes everywhere it might be a good option for PTSD ., Sad
146,"Oh ! I 'm glad you 're still here . I thought you were gone . Well , that is great for PTSD sufferers .", Happy
146,"no_more , it just takes me a while to think of what to say . Do you ever play dance video games ?", Curious to dive deeper
146,"No , but I enjoy dance performances . Did you know Tupac was a concert_dance dancer ?", Curious to dive deeper
146,"That is neat . Speaking of ballet dancers , they can go through four twain of pointe shoes a week . Sounds painful and expensive !", Curious to dive deeper
146,"Yes , that does , I agree ! I think its cute that babies hear music and spontaneously dance .", Happy
146,"When they hit the beat ! So babies can hit the beat but it seems wish a lot of us adult forget how to , haha .", Surprised
146,I know I have a hard time ! When cocker hit the beat it makes them smile ., Happy
146,One thing that makes me smileis Michael Jackson 's dance . one did n't know that to achieve lean he used a device which he patented ., Surprised
146,"That was smart . those moves were pretty uttermost , so that explains a lot of how it was done .", Happy
146,Right . Bruce Lee was another great dancer . He won a Cha Cha championship ., Surprised
146,Did he really ? Where did he do that ? In the USA ? Sounds like he is a multi-talented guy ., Curious to dive deeper
146,That was in Hong Kong.Now I want to see if there is any footage of him dancing . Have a good day !, Happy
147,make_out you like birds ? I love watching them !, Curious to dive deeper
147,"I do , too ! So many of them are beautiful , and even the single that are n't are still incredibly unique . They can be anywhere between 2 inches or 9 feet !", Neutral
147,I think it 's incredible how easily they can fly . It 's probably because their bones are so hollow that the entire skeleton weighs less than the feathers !, Happy
147,"Probably ! Did you know one of the smallest birds , a hummingbird , will actually steal spider webs construct and repair their nests ?", Neutral
147,"That 's funny ! There are wild birds in Australia that can mimic the sound of cameras , railroad_car alarms , and chainsaws . That could get noisey !", Happy
147,Wow . I wonder if they 're in the parrot family or if other birds remote of the parrot family can mimic sounds like that ?, Neutral
147,That 's a good possibility ! The extinct dodo bird is actually a sub family of pigeon . Interesting ., Happy
147,That is interesting ! Can you believe there are some birds that will migrate all the way from Alaska to Mexico without log_Z's ?, Neutral
147,That 's pretty incredible ! Do you like to dance ?, Curious to dive deeper
147,"Only if I 've had a couple of drinks , but I respect the art form absolutely . How about you ?", Neutral
147,I ca n't dance but wish I could . Tupac danced ballet in high school and ended up portraying the mouse king in the Nutcracker !, Happy
147,That 's pretty impressive ! Bruce Lee was also evidently a pretty good terpsichorean . He won the Hong Kong Cha-Cha Championship in 1958 !, Neutral
147,Wow . I had no idea he danced but I toilet see that going hand in hand with the karate moves ., Happy
147,Most definitely . Did you know babies spontaneously dance when they hear music ? i guess we as humans appreciate rhythm regardless of age !, Neutral
147,I did n't know that . Professional ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week . That could get expensive !, Happy
147,"Definitely ! Though atomic_number_53 can imagine why , standing on your tip-toes so frequently with all of your body weight must be extremely taxing on shoes !", Neutral
147,Ouch ! That 's all I 'll say . I would have broken toes . Michael Jackson has a patent on a device that was used to help him achieve the extreme lean in some of his dance moves ., Happy
147,"Hey , hold you ever played Tetris ?", Neutral
147,"I did back in the day . The 3 best selling videogames of all time are Tetris , Minecraft , and Wii sports . I had fun chatting with you !", Happy
147,"You , too ! I may go play some tetris , but that whole phenomenon of blocks falling in my sleep if I play too long freaks me out !", Neutral
147,LOL Have a big night !, Happy
148,Hello ! What do you enjoy doing for entertainment ?, Surprised
148,I really love to cook . Thanksgiving in my favorite holiday to cook for . Planning the meal and making everything fit on my oven is like tetris ., Curious to dive deeper
148,"Yes , so do I ! and I agree , Thanksgiving and Chsitmas are my favorite Holidays . and you are right especially if you only have one oven to work with like susan westmoreland says `` it 's a bit like an acrobatic dance '' lol", Curious to dive deeper
148,"Great way to make a word picture , yes ! I would totally agree . Planning backwards are what some experts say to do , like Susan Gage Caterers .", Curious to dive deeper
148,"haha , true ! Another of my all time fav things to do would be dance ! although my back doesnt like IT so much . I love watching dance videos ...", Curious to dive deeper
148,"Oh yeah , me too ! Dancing while I bake pies for Thanksgiving is an exacta . I have a guilty pleasure of dancing to ballet musicals . I read that those ballerina go through four pairs of pointe shoes per week . !", Curious to dive deeper
148,"That live a daily , cooking and dancing ! and ouch ! 4 pairs ! Oh my word , that beats my once every year . Another great dance was Michael Jackson , he had a patent on a device , I didnt know you could achieve lean in dance moves", Curious to dive deeper
148,"Really , that is a cool fact . I liked his music even though the person is in question .", Curious to dive deeper
148,"True , its hard to know true_statement from lies in the media unfortunately , Bruce lee was also a great dancer he even won the hong kong cha-cha championship in 1958 ! I didnt know there was such a thing .", Curious to dive deeper
148,"The Cha Cha winner ! How cool is that , Bruce Lee was an pose athlete all the way around . I think its so sweet how babies can spontaneously dance when they hear music.lol", Curious to dive deeper
148,"yes , I have 2 year old twin boys and they Love to `` shake shake shake , shake your booty '' haha they crack up everytime . They love to dance and watch our birds . Do you have birds ?", Curious to dive deeper

148,"Wow , yes birds are amazing creatures and so light ! their light bones are so hollow sometimes weighing less than their feathers . Love them .", Curious to dive deeper
148,"Yes , so delightful and treasured . Mine will mimic things that crap me run looking for alarms sometimes.lol", Curious to dive deeper
148,"haha , I incessantly wondered what such distances they can fly without resting . Ive learned that some birds can fly from alaska to northern mexico without sleeping .. I wish I could fly ! Vacations would be way cheaper !", Curious to dive deeper
148,"Gosh , that 's a good point and they would be a lot more affordable . I am addicted to diddle tetris when I fly because it takes my mind off of flying . Tetris is proven to be a quick and manageable fix for people who are trying to stick to a diet , quit smoking or drinking . I use it for flying .", Curious to dive deeper
148,"Tetris ! such a great game , reminds me of my youth , Its been around since ive been around lol well I guess tetris is axerophthol few years older 1984 it was created !", Curious to dive deeper
148,"Yes , mine too . It is one of three of the greatest games of all time . Minecraft and Sport Wii are the other two . The tetris game has been used to help people suffering with PTSD , also .", Curious to dive deeper
148,Interesting ! Do you know where it was created ?, Curious to dive deeper
148,"Yes , it was created in Russia by a man WHO almost never made any money from it but eventually he did in 1996 . I must admit I had the tetris effect for a while after I played . I would see everything in blocks and a way to fit .", Curious to dive deeper
148,"Wow , It was truly a great design and it traveled such a far way ... from Russia !", Curious to dive deeper

149,Your ? ; ) at that time You were cheering for Indians ?, Curious to dive deeper
149,Yes . I 'm not the owner of the team ; ) ... they 're just from my hometown ., Neutral
149,Although I 'm Polish - I got that ; ) lol . How are they dress these days ?, Curious to dive deeper
149,"Pretty good , on top of their division last year , but no where as good as the Red Sox . They had an amazing start to the year , and then they won the World Series .", Happy
149,"Holy crap , nice . Probably fat bonuses for everybody ... but hey ... if they made their fans happy , why the heck not ... they earned it !", Happy
149,"They did . It was almost too easy . They have great pitchers , good hitters , and a new manager . Normally , a new manager is n't a help , but he was from the team who won the World Series the year before , The Houston Astros .", Neutral
149,Huh ... do You think he knows a secret for winning World Series ? ; ) idk ... I think it 's just a well paid team ; ), Curious to dive deeper
149,"Money and chemistry build winning teams , if you ask me . Baseball is popular in the US , Japan , and a few other places . Is it played much in Polska ?", Curious to dive deeper
149,"Not really , but we do buy baseball bats : ) to proceed watch soccer games on a stadium : )", Curious to dive deeper
149,"You buy buggy ? Why ? I used to collect baseball cards , which can be quite valuable !", Curious to dive deeper
149,substantially ... when one soccer team meets other soccer team and those two towns/teams are not friendly ... You need to take whatever You can smuggle to the stadium to fight off the hooligans from the other team ; ) lol - baseball bats are selling good in Poland but nobody plays the game ; ) lol, Happy
149,"ah ... that 's a little scary . I suppose without a baseball bat , my simple weapon of choice would be ... something else I ca n't think of . Fascinating . I do like soccer . I 'm a Croatian ( half really ) , so the World Cup was exciting this year . Unfortunately , only the women 's world cup is more popular in the US than the baseball world series .", Sad

158,I 've heard that before . Japan likes it so much that they are actually shocked to learn that IT comes from america ., Neutral

158,"It is surprising . Speaking of surprising , did you know that the reason the managers wear uniforms is so they can go in the game if needed ?", Neutral

158,"It 's actually hard to turn your sport into a major force in the US . With the popularity of the NFL , MLB , NBA , and NHL , they dominate the sports scene .", Neutral
158,They definitely do at that . It 's sad to think about it though because the game has been around since 1887 ., Neutral

181,"I could n't even imagine , I would be so shocked . In japan baseball is very popular , and they are surprised to hear it ; s status as america 's national pastime ?", Curious to dive deeper
181,unity wonder why they were surprised . Baseball has always been such a popular game here in the states . Maybe because we are so synonomous with football ?, Curious to dive deeper
181,What is your favorite squad ?, Neutral
181,I guess if I had to pick I would go with the twins . They are a pretty decent team . I wonder if on_that_point was any twins cards in that guys 3 million dollar find ., Neutral
181,"peradventure , that must of been so cool to find them .", Neutral
181,I would be so excited to find something like that just sitting in my family 's attic . Since they were from the XL 's there had to be some amazing cards in there ., Happy
181,Do you collect anything ? I like to collect lid ., Curious to dive deeper
181,Not really unless kids costumes count . I always thought hats were super neat . They have such a long and full-bodied history ., Curious to dive deeper
181,"Yes they do , tipping your hat origin is from when a knight raises their visors .", Curious to dive deeper
181,That is a neat fact ! I love that people always associate the cowboy hat with the old west but really it was the bowler that was the favorite of the time ., Happy
181,That is true . The party hat originates from dunce caps ... they were worn at parties to encourage a Sir_Thomas_More foolish behavior !, Curious to dive deeper

182,Sometimes I follow baseball . Usually around playoffs . Did the national make a mistake ?, Neutral
182,"I do n't think so , they were n't doing too good in the standings plus they 're stadium was half empty", Neutral
182,"I guess information_technology was time to make a change , maybe rebuild .", Neutral
182,"Yea they were n't doing too unspoiled , they were in third place in their division behind the Phillies", Neutral
182,"I guess it 's tough to the lineup just right . Too many variables , and the team needs to gel as well .", Neutral
182,"Yea and the fans personify n't too happy with trading Daniel Murphy , guess he was a fan favorite", Neutral
182,Did he sell enough tickets though ? Probably most fans would want a winning team ., Neutral
182,"Probably , they can always let their baseball manager play as they are technically allowed to play", Neutral
182,"That 's a funny rule , is n't it . It must be a holdover from early_on days when a player also served as manager .", Neutral
182,"Yea , I remember back in the 1970s when Pete Rose was a manager he would sometimes play in the gage too", Neutral
182,Pete really was a competitive guy . He also bet against his team sometimes though ., Neutral
182,Yea that 's not good . I have old Pete Rose baseball cards but they 're not worth 3 million like the cards a man found in his grandfather 's dome, Neutral
182,"That guy must not have been able to believe his luck . I wonder what he did with the cards . I would have sold half and kept half . money now , plus a long-term investment .", Neutral
182,I 'd take group_A trip to Japan where baseball is also very popular, Neutral
182,"The baseball there is just not as good as in the US . Still , it 's a difference experience at the sports_stadium . It 's an interesting lesson in cultural difference .", Neutral
182,"I 'd like to visit England too , it 's funny how until 1998 their politicians had to wear a top hat in the house of commons", Neutral
182,I guess rules get held over for the sake of tradition . The old guard wants politicians in top hats and managers inward player uniforms ., Neutral
182,And Johnny Depp wears his Jack Sparrow costume to make visit to hospitals, Neutral
182,He really does his best for the kids . I like that he 's willing to make some jolly 's day better ., Neutral

184,"Hello , how do you do ?", Neutral
184,"hello , I 'm alright ! Have you seen the new Christopher Robin motion_picture ? I heard it was really for the whole family . I remember seeing the trailer where Pooh goes , `` They say nothing is impossible , but I do nothing every day ! '' I thought that line was funny .", Curious to dive deeper
184,"I thought it was a clever adaptation of a classic that help the now older audience reconnect and relate in order to reconnect to their youth , perhaps having imaginary pals of their own", Neutral
184,"Hmm .. sometimes I think all my pals are imaginary . Sadly , atomic_number_53 'm told the REAL Christopher Robin ( who the books were based on ) hated them and never took any money from them . I find that sad , since his father wrote the books for him ..", Sad
184,That is a shame . I wonder why the real chris hated them . Perhaps he wanted a father to be there for him rather than children books, Curious to dive deeper
184,"I think maybe he felt embarrassed because the books were based so heavily on his life . Did you know he go on Easter in 1996 ? That was one year after I graduated from high school . Man , I feel old ! LOL", Sad
184,Well I hope he at least found some solace in that it inspired and that it is a indispensable part of many children worldwide, Sad
184,"Yeah , hopefully . Anyway , like I said , I have n't seen it , I think I 'll check and see if my library has it though . I would get it from Netflix , but I do n't have a subscription at the moment . Are you on Netflix ? It 's pretty awesome ! They 've got like 137 million subscribers worldwide .", Curious to dive deeper
184,"While I understand their business model and why people enjoyment it , I never got it . It is impressive nonetheless that they account for 33 % of all bandwith in north america during peak hours", Neutral
184,"Yeah , I 've heard they 're especially busy in the late hours . Get this , they have an hour long movie that 's nothing but a roaring fireplace ! I think people play it a lot during the holidays or winter months to give their living rooms ( or whatever ) a decorative look .", Curious to dive deeper
184,I think that that is surprisingly practical for the ambiance . I bet blockbuster 's ghost repent not buying netflix, Neutral
184,"Ha , yeah ! I 'm told they laughed the Netflix people out of the office when they made an offer to them . They regret that decision for sure !", Happy
184,I mean if I could pay 50million today for 2 billion in a few years wow what an investment, Neutral
184,"Get this , Netflix has people on it 's staff who 's job is to watch the shows and tag the content ( guessing with genre tags and stuff . ) Get PAID to watch Netflix ? Where do I sign up for that ? LOL", Happy
184,That does sound nice . I wonder if they will start outsourcing to us turkers ?, Neutral
184,"Ha , we could only hope ! Course , if I had Netflix it would n't be just for the movies and tv shows , I think I 'd try some of their original programming as well . For instance , I heard the show `` Stranger Things '' was really good . possess you seen that one ?", Curious to dive deeper
184,"I have not , but I have heard good things about their original content lately .", Neutral
184,"Course , there 's so many subscription services it 's getting ridiculous . Hulu , Amazon , Netflix , heck even Disney is coming out ( or has it already ? ) with one for all their movies and properties .", Surprised
184,Well I mean they have to at least match up to their competitors so information_technology is understandable . All that is left for consumers is to see who provides the best service, Neutral
184,"Yeah , but it must suck if several of them offer exclusively shows/movies that you REALLY to see . When it was all just Netflix , you pretty much could get whatever you wanted ... Did you know Disney makes $ 1,110 per SECOND ? riot ... that blows my mind .", Sad
184,"That is amazing . Disney sure has come a long way and while you do n't really think of disney as a media company and more of a amusement park and animation studio , it is the largest media conglomerate in terms of revenue", Surprised
184,"I think information_technology 's crazy when you think about just how much STUFF they own now . I mean , Marvel , Star Wars , Pixar , the theme parks . It 's like they 're trying to completely take over the world ! ( laughs nervously )", Fearful
184,"I agree it is the time of big corporations . I wonder if the tv show where the earth is ruled by corporations instead of countries will come to go_across ? In any case , thank you for the wonderful chat .", Happy

186,I heard about it . Christopher Robin cost the adult version of winnie the pooh right ?, Neutral
186,"Yeah , that 's the one . Ewan McGregor is Christopher Robin as an adult . only he ends up going back to the land that Winnie the Pooh and Tiger and all of them live in .", Curious to dive deeper
186,"I imagine it 's plot sounds wonderful for not only children , but also adults to reconnect with their childhoods in a similar manner", Neutral
186,"Yeah . IT was pretty nostalgic for me since I used to love Winnie the Pooh as a kid . It was fun . I recommend it , if you 're interested .", Happy
186,mellifluous . It is too bad the real christopher robin disliked winnie the pooh, Neutral
186,Is that true ? I had n't heard about that ., Surprised
186,Ya I guess he felt it was too close to his real life and perhaps he would quite have a father than a child 's story, Neutral
186,"Wow ! That 's really interesting ! I can understand that . Unfortunately , the movie did n't really address any of that . That would have been cool to jazz as just a side bit of info while watching .", Surprised
186,"Well regardless of how the real Christoper felt , it is hard to deny the place of winnie the pooh in the hearts of millions of children and adults today", Neutral
186,True . Disney really hit it big getting to make that pic ., Neutral
186,Well disney has always done a good job in making great movies that are appealing to both children and adults, Neutral
186,Yeah for sure . Mickey and Minerva Mouse have sure laid the groundwork for many decades of great entertainment !, Curious to dive deeper
186,True . I mean there is even a whole subculture dedicated to recover the hidden mickey mouse references in all things disney, Neutral
186,Do you mean there actually is Mickey in every disney film ? Do you think that applies to Pixar too ?, Curious to dive deeper
186,"yes I do . People love their easter eggs . In any case , thanks for taking the time to chat .", Neutral

187,Have you seen the Christopher Robin film ? I was questioning how it was ., Curious to dive deeper
187,"no , I did n't . It sounds like it could have been good Ewan McGregor is a pretty good actor .", Curious to dive deeper
187,"Yes , he is . I suffice n't go see it , because I thought people would look at me strange seeing a `` kids '' movie . But I always liked Winnie the Pooh , as a child .", Happy
187,It was a good show . Did you know St._Christopher Robin was a real boy ?, Curious to dive deeper
187,"I heard that he was the author 's son in real life . That 's so cool , talk about having a book written about you .", Happy
187,I do n't have_it_away if I could handle that to be honest ., Curious to dive deeper
187,"Me either . Lol The New York public library is the home of the real Winnie the pooh toy teddy bear . I saw it once on a school trip , information_technology looked old and raggedy .", Happy
187,I did n't know that . soh they still have it ?, Surprised
187,"Yes , they do . It 's hard to believe that toy bear has n't fallen apart , yet . It 's like WW I era , that 's old .", Surprised
187,That 's pretty cool . I wonder if they offer the movie on Netflix ?, Curious to dive deeper
187,"They probably do , I 'm going to look for it and watch it , if they do .", Happy
187,Apparently netflix and youtube make up half of peak internet traffic in north america ., Curious to dive deeper
187,That I can totally see . And the other half is on Facebook .. lol, Surprised
187,"I believe it , although you have to wonder how much of that is actually instagram ?", Curious to dive deeper
187,How true . I heard that blockbuster had several chances to buy Netflix and did n't . Big mistake on their part ., Surprised
187,"I believe it , although you do n't know if they would have ran it as successfully .", Curious to dive deeper
187,"That 's true . Well , it 's equal nice talking with you , I 'll see you around .", Happy

188,"Oh I see . Some of them can constitute cool though , like that poem that when read normally is depressing and vice versa", Curious to dive deeper
188,"there is a 274 line poem called the chaos , i am assuming becaus it feature irregularly pronounced words", Neutral
188,"I would get_into so too . THe Javanese alphabet too , if recited in order it forms a poem", Curious to dive deeper
188,the vikings were warrior poet . lol what the heck ? did they just shout poetry at the enemy ?, Happy
188,Hahaha maybe that is how they fought . Allan Poe received only $ 9 for his poem The predate . Not is is priceless, Curious to dive deeper
188,is n't that always the way ? things do n't become priceless until the person is dead . baltimore must be the place for poetry ! first edgar allen Poe and also tupac, Neutral
188,"Yeah information_technology seems that way . On another topic , do you like dogs ?", Curious to dive deeper
188,Lol these really arent my favorite subjects . I am not a dog fan ., Neutral
188,"Oh I see . But just for curiosity , they have 12 blood types , way more than we do", Curious to dive deeper
188,they tail_end also reason better than chimps, Neutral
188,"Seem lie it since they understand pointing , same AS elephants", Curious to dive deeper
188,they enjoy solving a problem, Neutral
188,yea that too . Even Google has declared itself as a dog company, Curious to dive deeper
188,im guessing with that they allow employees to bring dogs to work ? I ca n't ever figure out what makes them a dog compnay, Surprised
188,Well maybe and they have it in their code of conduct that they are antiophthalmic_factor dog company, Curious to dive deeper
188,russia must really be into dogs they have a tomb of the unknown dog AND some of their dogs have learned to use the metro, Surprised
188,Wow that is impressive . For a long time I thought that dogs were colorblind but apprently they just do not see as many colors as we do, Curious to dive deeper
188,and they can learn over 1000 words . I guess thats why they make them service dogs, Surprised
188,"Yeah , it makes sense . Nice chat", Curious to dive deeper

189,I love the movie Apollo 13 on netflix . Can you believe that film inspired the whole service !, Surprised
189,No kidding ? I had no idea ! It 's amazing what good cinematography can inspire in others ., Surprised
189,"Nothing to do with the film , but founder Reed Hastings forgot to return a VHS tape and got $ 40 in late fees and wanted to do something about it !", Surprised
189,"Hah , I guess cinematography is n't everything . I think we all know how he must have felt getting a late fee . If only everyone were as determined to do something about frustrations !", Surprised
189,True . I do like cinematography though . It is amazing what can come from a lens and perch ., Surprised
189,"Cinematography is so fascinating . It 's like an intersection of physics and visual art , because of all the dependence on understanding how light and Lens work .", Curious to dive deeper
189,"True , just it is also about technology - how the sensor produces an electrical charge for each pixel .", Happy
189,unity ca n't pretend to understand all the technology behind it . It 's like magic in a way ., Neutral
189,"OK . I guess at_long_last it is about the people behind it , like James Wong Howe who won an Oscar .", Happy
189,Do you know what picture_show he won for ?, Curious to dive deeper
189,"I do not know , but he frequently used a crab dolly and deep-focus cinematography to create his style .", Happy
189,I wonder why some people have such a gift for cinematography . They look to be able to picture things in their minds that make such a visual impact even though others would n't imagine it beforehand ., Curious to dive deeper
189,"Very True . Stanley Kubrick had a vision and took the tv_camera from his cinematographer , but allowed him to keep the credit .", Surprised
189,"I would be awfully annoyed if iodine were that cinematographer , haha . First I ca n't do my job , then I get credit for something I did n't even do !", Happy
189,"I suppose , but the oscar and residuals from Spartacus probably help !", Surprised
189,"That 's true . I would n't mind getting paid for not having to do my job either , and as a cinematographer , he probably had a lot of appreciation for seeing Oscar-worthy work done in front of him by Kubrick .", Neutral
189,Perhaps the Internet flick Database IMDb should create a new category for things like this !, Happy
189,That would be a great new addition . I use IMDB to look up moves and actors/actresses all the time ., Neutral
190,Have you seen Kevin Spacey in the `` Billionaire Boys Club '' movie ?, Curious to dive deeper
190,"I have n't seen it , actually . Is IT any good ?", Curious to dive deeper
190,"I have n't . I heard that it 's opening was a career low opening day total for Spacey , though . It 's because of all the bad accusations against him , I think .", Curious to dive deeper
190,"I saw him in the movie Baby Driver , but the accusations are definitely a check for some people with how widespread # MeToo has become", Neutral
190,"Yes , I actually have n't seen him in a movie since American Beauty . I watch movies on Netflix sometimes . Do you ?", Curious to dive deeper
190,"I have to be in the mood since I like to read and listen to a lot of books . I tend to create a watchlist on Netflix faster than I can watch things , but I like how convenient it is . I ca n't imagine having to rent movies from Blockbuster", Neutral
190,Netflix is really popular now . I hear it accounts for a third of completely the bandwidth in North America during late night ., Surprised
190,"I think the shows and movies supporter people unwind now , and there 's no commercial breaks . Combined with YouTube , the two account for half the bandwidth in North America", Neutral
190,I hear Netflix actually spends more on postage than on bandwidth . The owner started the company after being annoyed by a late fee of his VHS movie rental ., Neutral
190,"I would be annoyed about a rental fee that 's higher than it costs for the VHS . It 's still strange to think that people still use the rental service , but I guess internet connection is n't always the best inch some places", Neutral
190,Yes I think maybe it 's from parents getting stuff for their nestling to watch while they can watch streaming Netflix at the same time ., Curious to dive deeper
190,"Netflix is capable of streaming on More than one device at the same time depending on the subscription . Either way , it 's still better than if Blockbuster had bought Netflix", Neutral
190,"Of course . I think some wifi ca n't handle that , though . Yes , I heard they actually turned down buying Netflix . It was for much lower of a price than it 's worth straight_off , too !", Surprised
190,I think their value went up once they started creating their own content . It 's part of the appeal now to keep users loyal, Neutral
190,"Yes , Netflix creating their own content seems like it 's part of a cinematography revolution or something !", Happy
190,"Maybe if they team up with cinematographer Roger Deakins , his 14th nomination for the Oscars will be the one that finally wins . Losing 13 times would be hard", Curious to dive deeper
190,"Yes , that would be hard . along the bright side , I bet not many cinematographers have been putting out such mention worthy work for so many years !", Curious to dive deeper
190,"Not since James Wong Howe back in the 1940s . He was Chinese before at_last becoming a citizen , but he used techniques such as low lighting and wide-angle lenses before it was popular", Neutral
190,Sounds like a very talented and revolutionary cinematographer . One of my favorites is Stanely Kubrick . He did Spartacus ., Happy
190,"I 've heard of him , though he did n't get the credit for his work . Sounds comparable a stand-up guy though", Neutral
190,"Well I guess he 's commonly considered a producer , but he did a lot of the work on Spartacus . He is a cool guy ... you should look up an interview of his .", Happy
191,Have you ever been on a blind date ?, Curious to dive deeper
191,No but I heard blind dates put_up be quite successful and lead to marriage, Neutral
191,I did too and people rate them on a 1-5 scale . suffice you think people care about their date 's shoes ?, Curious to dive deeper
191,"I think women tend to care more about the shoes then men , men tend to only guardianship more about function than style", Neutral
191,Did you know that professional ballet dancers go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week ? I hope they 're not too expensive !, Surprised
191,That 's insane . I precisely learned they have Wizard of Oz inspired shoes that can guide you home when you click you heels, Neutral
191,That 's pretty cool ! I like that Steve Smith leaves his cleat every game to make people aware of the homeless without shoes ., Happy
191,"Yea , that is very thoughtful . Did you know in the 9th century Persian Cavalry soldiers wore high-heeled shoes >", Curious to dive deeper
191,I ca n't imagine soldiers in high heels ! Another thing I ca n't imagine because it 's portrayed differently is that pilgrims break tons of colorful clothes and black only for special occasions ?, Surprised
191,I never knew that but there are still African tribes that wear old Victorian clothing so anythings possible, Neutral
191,Me either . Did you know Apple had a clothing line 1986 ? I thought they only did technology ..., Curious to dive deeper
191,"Well there are some odd clothing compaines , Miguel Cabarello makes bulletproof clothings", Neutral
191,I wonder if that is extra heavy ? I would love to visit the store in Alabama that sells clothes etc from unclaimed baggage at the airport . I bet in_that_respect 's some interesting things ., Neutral
191,"Speaking of airport clothing , a man indium China once wore 70 clothing items just to avoid bagging fees", Neutral
191,"Well the fees are getting high on some airlines ! I wonder how much it happens that a label says made somewhere , but is really made elsewhere like with Rip Curl ?", Curious to dive deeper
191,Probably a lot . Did you know at Billy Mays funeral the pallbearers wore blue shirts and khaki ?, Curious to dive deeper
191,I would love to see a gang_up in America layer shirts with popped collars like they did in China !, Neutral
191,"Lol , sounds better than distinguish Zuckerburgs plain shirts that cost $ 300- $ 400", Neutral
191,That 's crazy ! It would be nice to have business attire be an ciao shirt like in Hawaii . I would be much more comfortable ., Happy
191,Yea that sounds much more comfortable than a blue shirt and khakis, Neutral
191,1 agree ! Have a great night !, Neutral

203,"I think it is amazing ! Not only the constitution and history of earth , but also its position relative to other planets in the solar system .", Happy
203,"I agree , so many wonders to think we only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds on a 24 hour calendar of Earth 's history .", Curious to dive deeper
203,What behave you mean ?, Curious to dive deeper
203,"I mean that if 4.5 billion years of histoy equals 24 hours then humans have only exist for 1 minute and 17 seconds of that 24 hour period ,", Curious to dive deeper
203,"Oh wow ! That is really neat , time really does fly ! I really appreciate these tech billionaire 's efforts into space exploration , like Elon Musk and his bold initiative to start colonization in Mars .", Surprised
203,I heard he wants to build a ultrasonic vertical take off jet ., Curious to dive deeper
203,"Whatever that is , it just sounds super cool ! I wonder how he finds time the to do all these things , he 's the CEO of Tesla , SpaceX , Neuralink , and The Boring Company , chairman of SolarCity . It makes me seem very unproductive", Surprised
203,"I know information_technology seems like he wouldnt have much time , he is also an actor and producer , seems like he has more than 24 hours in his day .", Curious to dive deeper
203,"He is AN actor and producer ? I did n't know that , do you know which movies/TV shows he is involved with ?", Curious to dive deeper
203,He 's in a yield called `` Thank you for smoking '' ; I have n't seen it either though ., Curious to dive deeper
203,"That seems a little ironic for his recent ordeal with smoking marijuana during an interview with the host and was fined , I think . His wife or ex-wife also appeared in Christopher Nolan 's film , Inception .", Surprised
203,Thats Elon Musk 's wife ? I didnt know that ! she is a good actress ., Curious to dive deeper
203,"I 'm not sure which character she played , but according to the article , she appeared in it . I wonder if that movie inspired him to create any of his companies .", Surprised
203,"Could be , so anyway , do you like horses ?", Curious to dive deeper
203,"Yes , but I would never ride a gymnastic_horse to school like what two high school students did on the `` no vehicles to school day '' , very creative though", Surprised
203,"I agree , really creative for trusted , I bet they got in a lot of trouble too .", Curious to dive deeper
203,"Yes , they were suspended , which seems a little harsh to Maine .", Surprised
203,IT does seem harsh but then again the horses could lose control and create a lof of chaos ., Curious to dive deeper
203,"Yes , especially if they had brought Icelandic horses , which have a fifth speed , called the tolt , which is deoxyadenosine_monophosphate speedwalking unit for a horse", Happy
203,Can you imagine all the chaos ? Another cool fact comprise that Clint Easthood is allergic to horses ., Curious to dive deeper
204,"Hi , how are you ? do like horses ?", Neutral
204,"Hey in_that_respect I love horses . Even though I 'm allergic to them they are still very fun to ride , what do you think", Curious to dive deeper
204,"You 're allergic ? Are you Clint Eastwood ? LOL . I 've never ridden a horse , but they seem like majestic animals .", Neutral
204,"I wish I were Clint Eastwood ! But I never knew that Iceland actually has a specific horses with a fifth speed , other horses do not have this ability for roughly reason", Surprised
204,"I do n't understand the speeds . Trot , gallop , ? ? ? What else is there ?", Neutral
204,"yes its something called Tolt , I do n't know exactly how fast that is though lol", Surprised
204,"i guess they have used horses there for many purposes . What do you think of the two high school students who rode their horses to school on 'no vehicles to school day ' , and got suspended ?", Neutral
204,I think that was genius but pretty dumb that they got suspended haha . What suffice you think about Dalmatians ? Do you know how they are related to horses, Curious to dive deeper
204,I know that they ar used by firefighters . I heard that they were deaf or something ., Neutral
204,Yes a lot of them are actually deaf . What do you think about Elon Musk by the way ? I know that 's a change of topic haha, Curious to dive deeper
204,"That is a change of topic . He is not a dalmatian , or a horse , or deaf . I think that he is ambitious and trying to create new applied_science . You ?", Neutral
204,Yes he seems very smart and also very ambitious . I think he has a dog but it 's not a Dalmatian though haha . His wife also appeared in the movie Inception by the way, Surprised
204,I thought he got divorced ? Is he still married ? She must be somewhat ., Neutral
204,"I think he is still married . I 'm not sure what she looks like though , did you ever watch the movie thank you for smoking by the way ?", Curious to dive deeper
204,"Yes , I did . A long time ago . An interesting film . I like Aaron whatshisname .", Neutral
204,"Yes I did like that movie , Elon Musk plainly produced it and I forgot that he acted in it too", Surprised
204,"I 'll have to check for that . He is a talented , intelligent guy .", Neutral
204,"Yep absolutely . I love that he wants to create a vertical take-off jet , that also is electric , I think that would be cool I would love to have that haha", Surprised
204,"His ideas are astronomical . Anyway , great chat ! Have a good night ! Go watch Thanks for Smoking again .", Neutral
204,"Yes I 'm going to check it out very soon , I 'm going to keep my eyes peeled for Elon Musk haha . also I 'll keep my eyes peeled for his rocket that will colonize Mars haha", Happy
204,"Yes , I will wait for Elon to travel on IT first though before I go . Talk to you soon !", Neutral
204,"sounds good , I 'll be hold_back for Spacex !", Happy
205,"Earth never stops to amaze me , it was formed over 4.5 billion years agone and there is still much to learn about our planet", Curious to dive deeper
205,I know what you mean . It is the only object known to have life and we need to know why that is ., Neutral
205,"I agree , we must find life in other planets if we want to survive as a species , its sad how 80 % of the forests have been destroyed by at_present", Sad
205,That is definitely sad and very troubling . It makes me wonder what testament happen to the polar regions with all of the ice ., Neutral
205,Global Warming happened to them and if we dont start caring about our planet we might need to find another one shortly ., Curious to dive deeper
205,Already things are changing . Did you know that there will be no helium on the planet by the end of this century ? Not only are we losing plants and animals but now we are losing elements ., Neutral
205,"I did not know that , I wonder how that will affect us , im sure it will have hidden consequences on life on earth and to think we account to only a small portion of world history", Curious to dive deeper
205,I imagine it will have consequences too . I 've heard that when the earth was first formed a day was only just over 5 hours long . That would be weird . I guess that means the planet used to be closer to the sun ?, Neutral
205,"Yeah , it seems that way , or maybe rotated at a bigger speed , you know we make an embassador in case aliens arrive to the planet or try to make contact with us .", Surprised
205,"I did n't know that ! That 's actually pretty cool ! I hope he or she is friends with Elon Musk . At the rate he is going , he 'll find life before the government does . He 's already planning a colony on Mars .", Neutral
205,"Elon Musk is a genious , hopefully he is successful with his colonisation plan , he is also an role_player you know", Curious to dive deeper
205,one did n't know that . I knew he co founded paypal but I had no idea he acted as well ., Surprised
205,"Yeah apparently he acted in a thank you for smoking sketch , and his wife is an actress as well she was in the movie Inception", Happy
205,Impressive . I like that he is into solar energy . He inspired a solar company and now it 's part of Tesla ., Neutral
205,"He is looking into the future that is for sure , he also wanted to physical_body a vertical take off jet for passangers .", Curious to dive deeper
205,"That would be different . I wonder if it would have benefits that the normal way does n't . You know he thinks outside the box . When he wants to do something he just does it , like shooting a cheese wheel into space .", Neutral
205,"That is an absurd way to waste money lol , shooting a cheese wheel into space ! amazing but at the same time wasteful .", Curious to dive deeper
205,If you got it why not ? He is worth over 20 billion dollars after all ., Neutral
205,"Yeah I guess so , just seems like a waste with all the poor families and kids without homes in the world , to think Musk was born in 1971 , he sure has taken advantage of his time on earth", Sad
205,He really has . I think he can be inspiring . I can see how it could be wasteful to spend money like that but on the other hand he shows people to just do what they want with what they have . It 's a lot like Galileo back in the day building a telescope . To me it 's a way to say give your imagination free reign and try stuff . Tesla is an electronic car company that he founded in the day and age where the big automakers dominate but he is giving it a try ., Neutral
205,"Yeah I guess his contributions to socitety are bigger , one day he will be commemorate as Galileo and other historic figures .", Curious to dive deeper
206,Have you ever seen the movie Snowden, Curious to dive deeper
206,"non yet . I know that 's about the whistle blower who escaped to Russia , right ?", Curious to dive deeper
206,Yeah founder of Wikileaks . You know they published the government 's plans to destroy them ., Curious to dive deeper
206,"That 's right . I forgot that he found Wikileaks also . I did n't know that , but I recently learned that the government owns 86 % of NV Edwin_Herbert_Land .", Curious to dive deeper
206,"That 's a lot of land to be own by the government , what 's their game plan , lol", Curious to dive deeper
206,Maybe Snowden knows ! Apparently government_activity are to abide by governing principles that are to balance individual freedom and tyranny ., Curious to dive deeper
206,"Yeah sounds suspect . In 2006 , the us blow_over legislation that would protect government employees from being prosecuted for violating the Geneva conventions", Curious to dive deeper
206,Also sounds suspect . Did you lie_with that Albert Einstein was asked to be Israel 's president ? But he declined ., Curious to dive deeper
206,That 's deep . Franklin D. Roosevelt tried to invite Albert mastermind to the White House ., Curious to dive deeper
206,"Yeah , and the letter was intercepted and then the invitation was declined by Flexner .", Curious to dive deeper
206,Sounds like another administration i can think of ., Curious to dive deeper
206,"Einstein was very involved in American politics . To this Clarence_Day , his estate earns $ 18 million annually .", Neutral
206,He was take_over in Germany right ?, Curious to dive deeper
206,"Yes , but he was very worldly . He was also a member of the NAACP and he charged $ 1 for his autograph . All of that collected money was donated to charities .", Neutral
206,Well that does n't sound too bad . This is strange though Albert einstein wrote a quote in 1938 and locate it in a time capsule to be opened in 6939 ., Curious to dive deeper
206,6939 . I wonder why so far into the future . He was a scientist and developed the theory of relativity so maybe he saw something happening in this distant future ., Curious to dive deeper
206,"Maybe , thats too far in the future for ME . It was not until the 19th century that the term scientist came into regular use after it was coined by the theologian , philosopher , and historian of science William Whewell in 1833 .", Curious to dive deeper
206,Just a little too far ha-ha . And natural philosophy was a precursor of natural science ., Happy
206,They say that Harrison schmitt cost the only scientist to walk on the moon ., Curious to dive deeper
206,Einstein would have been in all his glory if he had the chance . And it would have been well deserved since he wrote to Roosevelt about uranium being turned into bombs ., Curious to dive deeper
206,Yeah he did a lot more than what he 's best known for mass vitality equivalence formula E = mc2, Curious to dive deeper
206,"Eureka ! He sure did . But anyway , I enjoyed our jaw ! It was very informative . I hope you have a great evening .", Happy
206,you too !, Curious to dive deeper
206,make care !, Neutral
207,"Are you axerophthol science fan ? did you know that the estate of Einstein earns more that 18,000,000 a year ? Pretty amazing inventor !", Curious to dive deeper
207,one do love science . There is so many cool things to explore such as computers or chemistry ., Curious to dive deeper
207,Did you know that Albert Einstein was born in Germany and is best known for for his equation E= mc2 ?, Neutral
207,I did know that . I observe it intersting he wrote to Roosevelt about nuclear energy so long ago . We tend to think of it as a modern thing beyond the A bomb, Curious to dive deeper
207,It seems ironic that scientist put_option men on the moon but Harrison Schmitt was the only one to actually walk on the moon ., Neutral
207,I think astronauts need a different temperment than person who works in a lab or engineering . There has to be a sense of thrill seeking that seems to be lacking in a lot of scientists ., Neutral
207,So true . The world wide web was invented in 1989 by and english scientist working in Switzerland for a state funded research organization . . .How much it changed the world !, Curious to dive deeper
207,It really has ! I think it has impacted our economy and countries in ways that are unimaginable . I wonder if they knew what they were inventing when they serve it ., Curious to dive deeper
207,I am sure they had no idea ! There were two geniuses that invented things without thought of how they were to be used Hertz and Maxwell . Had this thought that curiosity shoud motor invention, Curious to dive deeper
207,I think curiousity is a great thing . The internet sure has helped with that . Imagine the information we have access to now that generations past had so much trouble access ., Curious to dive deeper
207,So often only governing and universities can fund the research for projects in science without an immediate need . It is kind of like an essay in Harpers magazine in 1939 titled `` The usefulness of Useless Knowledge ., Neutral
207,If only that money was cast to better use ., Angry
207,"It is a bit like the scientist Hertz that worked out electromagnetism . Macaroni , did selfsame little of the science but he was credited with inventing radio !", Neutral
207,I think the pointless project funding goes back to entitlement spending . People start to think they can spend just because they want to ., Disgusted
207,I think that was on the tails of the industrial revolution . I think that know with spending out of control only endowed universities have the luxury of funding research without a product goal ., Neutral
207,The problems lie in the fact that it is doing nothing but driving us deeper into debt as federal funding goes to these pointless projects that are driven in the name of research for research 's sake and has no practical value ., Disgusted
207,"That is so true now . In the days of the 30s , 40s , and fifties , the inventions such as dishwashers , air conditioners , and fax automobile would drive the economy up .", Neutral
207,I think if we were to address the cost of inflation and the realities of what our administration has done to the economy vs what other countries are doing we would be in a better place as a nation in america ., Angry
207,"I do n't think that we would have the luxuries in our homes and lives that we have now without scientist . as a sidenote , did you know that Einstein answered his own mail ?", Surprised
207,I could see that . He seemed like a very down to earth man for how brilliant he was ., Neutral
207,That he could do that and pull_in the Nobel Prize for Physics shows that he was somewhat down to earth ., Curious to dive deeper
207,He was a brilliant and kind man who impacted the science community in so many ways ., Neutral
208,"Hello , do you follow the government ?", Curious to dive deeper
208,"A little bit , they own almost all of Nevada .", Neutral
208,"Yep , they own 86 % of the state which cost crazy .", Surprised
208,"They did test a lot of nuclear bombs there , so unity do n't think anyone would want those areas .", Neutral
208,Very good point . Did you know Wikileaks published the government 's plan to shutdown Wikileaks ?, Surprised
208,"No , but it is seems lucid given the nature of government and Wikileak 's nature to publish them .", Neutral
208,True . A man in France once impersonated a government official and was capable to sell the Eiffel Tower twice ., Surprised
208,"Yeah , I feel a little bad for the people that fell for it , especially the first one , he was so ashamed that he did non called to police .", Sad
208,Me too . The Norwegian government once gave $ 1 billion to help save the virago rainforest ., Surprised
208,Do you think they will succeed ? I hope so ., Curious to dive deeper
208,I hope therefore too . Do you know much about Einstein ?, Curious to dive deeper
208,I know he was a scientist . Is he German ?, Curious to dive deeper
208,"Yep , he was German . He was once asked to be the president of Israel .", Surprised
208,Why would they ask him to be president of Israel ? He must have made a ton of money with all those posters with his face ., Neutral
208,Not really sure . I also saw he was a member of the NAACP ., Surprised
208,"So he was actively for civics right , he seems a good man but a quirky one I have heard that he wrote something and put it is a time capsule that will be opened in 6939 .", Surprised
208,He was a good man and very smart . That 's cool about the time capsule . Did you know he would charge $ 1 for his autograph ?, Surprised
208,"That is a lot for the time , what did he do with the money ?", Curious to dive deeper
208,Not really sure lol . Seems amp little bizarre . It was good chatting with you !, Happy
208,"Good , but there are other interesting scientist to talk about like the emperor of Japan who is also a scientist .", Curious to dive deeper
208,That 's good . Take care !, Happy
209,How do you call_up our government is doing ?, Curious to dive deeper
209,"Hi , I think they are doing pretty good right now . What coiffe you think ?", Curious to dive deeper
209,"I think so too , lots of drama with IT , but as long as they are doing their job I am fine with it", Curious to dive deeper
209,For sure . I saw Wikileaks once published the government 's plan to shutdown Wikileaks ., Surprised
209,"that is awesome , that is really sticking it to the man . I wonder if they released why 86 % of Nevada personify owned by the government", Curious to dive deeper
209,That 's ampere lot of Nevada they own . I bet there are tons of secret bases and things like that out there ., Surprised
209,"I am sure there has to be . It is all desert , but iodine am sure they are doing some crazy things there", Curious to dive deeper
209,"I bet they are . In 2008 , the Norwegian government donated $ 1 billion to help save the Amazon rainforest .", Surprised
209,"Wow , that is something ! I wish we did that but I think we donate billions already to other countries with aid .", Curious to dive deeper
209,Yes we do donate a lot . A man in France once impersonated a government official and was able to sell the Eiffel Tower twice, Surprised
209,"that is awesome ! not once , but twice ! Someone had to have gotten fired ended it lol", Curious to dive deeper
209,I agree . Do you know much roughly Einstein ?, Curious to dive deeper
209,I know he was some super smart guy and scientist . I think his estate gets a ton of money still, Curious to dive deeper
209,"He was really smart . Looks like his estate gets $ 18,000,000 annually .", Surprised
209,"wow that is a ton of money , literally ! I wonder what for . I am sure he has a ton of patents", Curious to dive deeper
209,I bet . Einstein was a member of the NAACP ., Surprised
209,"that is awesome , he did n't discriminate . He lived during those times . I think he was asked to be the president of Israel also once", Curious to dive deeper
209,That 's pretty cool . Did you lie_with he charged $ 1 for his autograph ?, Surprised
209,that is awesome ! I hope he donated the money to charity or something . It was nice chitchat with you !, Curious to dive deeper
209,It was good chatting with you too . Did you know the emperor of Japan is a scientist as well ?, Surprised
209,wow that is pretty crazy stuff ! What a smart dude ! Enjoy your day !, Curious to dive deeper
210,Hi there ! Do you think voting is important ?, Curious to dive deeper
210,"No today i do n't , sorry i think it 's all rigged.What about you ?", Curious to dive deeper
210,"Yeah , sadly , I feel the same . Maybe the system still needs to be developed . Up until 1918 not all men in UK had the vote .", Sad
210,Right i heard that . Did you know astronauts get to vote from space ?, Curious to dive deeper
210,Neat ! And in India they even set up a voting booth for one voter in area saturated with lions ., Surprised
210,Guess they did want him to vote . That vocalise unusually cruel ., Curious to dive deeper
210,"i wonder if in India they vote what to name their garbage dumps . In Austin , Texas they voted to name theirs after Fred Durst .", Curious to dive deeper
210,"Wow that is to funny , i wonder why ? Another unfortunate fact is that 34 % of black males will never have the chance to vote", Curious to dive deeper
210,That 's sorry . And a lot of eligible voters do not show up . The turnout for presidential elections has not reached 63 percent in the last 100 years ., Sad
210,Right ! heres an interesting fact since 1900 the tall candidate has always won ., Curious to dive deeper
210,Wow ! So officials in Ancient Athens were appointed by lottery . They thought elections would cause oligarchy . And have_sex the fact you just told me does n't make me have faith in the system either !, Sad
210,It ' supposed to Be a formal group decision making process by which a population chooses an individual to hold public office . We know it ; s not ., Curious to dive deeper
210,Do you think they should add a none of these candidates voting option for all elections ?, Curious to dive deeper
210,I 'm on the fence about that . I know Nevada has it but i wonder what the benefits are beside knowing who voted and who did n't ., Curious to dive deeper
210,"Yeah , there necessarily to be electoral reform , so that fair electorial systems are put in place .", Sad
210,Right i 'm with you . Did you know that one of the moons of Jupiter would be considered a planet if it orbited the sun ?, Curious to dive deeper
210,"Wow . Speaking of planets , I was sad when Pluto was deemed not a planet ! I grew up being taught that it was !", Sad
210,I know and then all of a sudden right ! I hear they discovered building block for life some 455 light years away . I wonder how ?, Curious to dive deeper
210,"Yeah , I 'm not sure . And I always thought planets spun in a similar manner . Venus make n't tilt so it has no seasons , and it also rotates clock wise unlike other planets .", Surprised
210,Wow ! Hey there a five planets in our solar system that can be seen with the naked eye ., Curious to dive deeper
210,"assuredness , I want to go out right now and see how many I can spot . Have a good night !", Happy
211,planet are pretty crazy if you think about it, Curious to dive deeper

211,"Jupiter 's moon ganymede would be a planet if it orbited the sun , do you know any ?", Curious to dive deeper
211,"I have heard that some planets dont have a tilted axis , and others spin on their SIDE . crazy , huh ?", Neutral
211,"wow , very crazy , what would earth be like spinning on information_technology side lol . I heard Uranus rolls around the sun", Curious to dive deeper
211,"URANUS ? < chuckle > What a name ! Yes , i wonder what is wrong with that planet besides its awkward name .", Neutral
211,"Right lol ! imagine a planet where shards of glass come_down sideways at you , that is a real thing", Curious to dive deeper
211,that sounds like a terrible vacation . i would rather go that planet 455 light years away ., Neutral
211,"right , I see about that planet , it can possible sustain life right ?", Curious to dive deeper
211,It might . we should get Elon to get some people headed toward the thing ., Neutral
211,"Right , that could be his next venture . You think we will see a man on mars in our lifetime ?", Curious to dive deeper
211,"Yes , we will , but how long can they be there ? and what displace they do that a probe cant ?", Neutral
211,"That is a valid point , I am glad someone is spending money on it . Do you think the Space Force will patrol it lol ?", Curious to dive deeper
211,"Um , i dont know about the Space Force . Maybe ? THe govt has twenty-two trillion in debt . it is not a popular idea at the moment .", Neutral
211,"I think our elected president will push it like the wall , are you a fan of him ?", Curious to dive deeper
211,I am not really a trump fan . the wall is going to cost in the next budget . about 8 billion . i think that the 2020 election is going to be interesting ., Neutral
211,"I think so too , I wonder who he will run against . I think if he wins it will show it be rigged again , but that is my opinion", Curious to dive deeper
211,The democratic field is a jumble now . it is unclear how the dems will come up with someone to run against an incumbent ., Neutral

212,Yes of course . Did you know the indian government put_option a poll in a forested area full of lions for a single voter ?, Curious to dive deeper
212,I hazard the gov't needs to make sure everyone has a chance to vote . The US is different . The voter turnout for presidential elections has n't exceeded 62.8 % in the last 100 years, Neutral
212,"I can not believe more people do not get out and vote , teally", Curious to dive deeper
212,They probably feel that their options are poor . Except in Nevada.Nevada is the only state to have the `` none of these candidates '' voting option for presidential elections, Neutral
212,I like to have that option really . Did you know astronauts vote from space ?, Curious to dive deeper
212,I figure they have the right . I wonder what percentage of astronauts actually vote ., Neutral
212,Maybe all of them I hope . even in uk not al men had the right to vote until 1918, Curious to dive deeper

212,That is an interesting one . In ancient athens officials were appointed away lottery, Curious to dive deeper

213,I thought it was very thoughtful and sad about all the mass shootings around in FL and Las Vegas, Neutral
213,I thought it was pitiful too . It 's a shame that people have to resort to shooting students as well as teachers . It 's not even safe to go to school anymore, Fearful
213,I wish there could be non-polarizing give-and-take on it between society and politicians, Neutral
213,There needs to be a conversation about it . Maybe it will reach out to people and the shootings will stop . Parents should n't have to worry about what 's going to happen to their children when they send them to school ., Sad
213,I guess it 's important to vote for politicians who care about the people they represent and not lobbyists or the party line, Neutral
213,"Exactly . All certain politicians care about is money.They do n't care about what is best for people . If they did , things would be honorable and maybe the violence would end .", Angry
213,"Yep , in ancient athens official were appointed by lottery to avoid an oligarchy", Neutral
213,Maybe that should be done here in the U.S . Most likely Trump would n't be in office if the elections was done by lottery ., Neutral
213,"No , unfortunitly voter turnout has n't breached 62.8 % in the last 100 years so that may be why the country is in such bad cast", Neutral
213,"You 're probably right . Some people feel like their vote does n't count so they do n't bother . Then again , maybe the taller candidate won as the article claims . That does explain how certain people are elected", Neutral
213,I think Nevada sustain it right with the option `` none of the candidates '' as a voting option, Neutral
213,I think they have information_technology right too . It gives you the option not to vote for people you do n't think are good enough to be in office, Neutral
213,"People vote for interest things , Austin TX voted to rename their garbage dump to Fred Durst", Surprised
213,They really do . I wonder why they wanted to name it after him . I also wonder why all men could n't vote until 1918, Neutral
213,"I do n't sleep_together , I also do n't know why there are polling booths in forests filled of lions in India", Surprised
213,I do n't know why there are polling booths like that either . It also never occurred to me that astronauts can vote from space, Neutral
213,That 's nuts . Jupiter 's moon ganymede would be considered a planet if it orbited the sunlight, Neutral
213,It is . I find it strange how venus does n't have time_of_year, Neutral
213,"Yea , Uranus personify strange too since it rotates sideways", Neutral
213,Exactly . That is very strange . Just like the planet where sherd of glass precipitate sideways, Neutral
213,"Shards of glass and 2000 degree weather , sounds fun", Neutral
214,"Hi , how are you ?", Happy
214,I 'm great ! How are you ?, Curious to dive deeper
214,"Well , thanks ! How is your smelling ability", Curious to dive deeper
214,"It 's pretty good , on par will most . I still can synthesize my own vitamin C .", Neutral
214,How is your auditory_sense ?, Curious to dive deeper
214,"Hearing is pretty expert . Like most humans , I have excellent distant running abilities . Well , maybe I used to .", Neutral
214,There is a sound frequency that induce fear in humans ! That seems weird ..., Fearful
214,"I think it 's 13 hertz , very low , below our threshold of hearing . Causes fear because I think information_technology 's like an earthquake sound .", Neutral
214,Reallly ? ? ? That 's impressive knowledge ! Do you know anything about ribs, Curious to dive deeper
214,"I 've read that they grow back stronger after they get broken , but I have n't tested that out myself .", Curious to dive deeper
214,Yeah . I know if you smoke them with BBQ sauce for 2 hours on 180 they are delicious ..., Happy
214,"That type_A good tip , but they probably wo n't heal well after that .", Neutral
214,"No , I am not good for the healing portion of ribs . one am on the other side of the healing line . I wonder how many ribs a black swallower fish can eat ...", Curious to dive deeper
214,Times times their weight ? They would get kicked out of the smorgasbord ., Neutral
214,Yeah ! They would do some damage ... I wonder how they would consume water ?, Curious to dive deeper
214,I do n't have_it_away whether they are freshwater or saltwater fish ., Neutral
214,That would make the difference . I kknow they do not take_in necks ..., Happy
214,The humble seahorse is the only fish to have a neck . But it 's not immortal !, Neutral
214,"Is there anything that is deity , besides Hulk Hogan ?", Curious to dive deeper
214,There is a breed of jellyfish that 's immortal . Probably goes by the nickname `` Hulk Hogan . '', Neutral
214,HA ! dainty chatting with you !, Happy
215,It personify amazing how a certain scent can ellict specific memories from throughout your life is n't it ?, Curious to dive deeper
215,"I know , I can catch a faint smell of something and be reminded of something from 20 years ago .", Neutral
215,"Yes , like a summer rain always reminds me of walking through the woods as a boy . It 's too bad we ca n't replicate those scents and be reminded of our childhood all of the time .", Happy
215,"I 've never thought about it , but I suppose we do n't have names for smells , just where it comes from .", Curious to dive deeper
215,That 's true I refer to a damp basement smell as moldy but why not concern to the smell of onions as 'yuk ' ?, Curious to dive deeper
215,"It 's difficult to imagine having identify for each smell , as we have for colors . I 'd think there were too many .", Curious to dive deeper
215,"Yes , but imagine if the defining term could relate to the listener not only what the smell was precisely but perhaps even information_technology 's location . Maybe other languages allow for more descriptive labels .", Curious to dive deeper
215,"I suppose if you cause to survive , partially because of your nose , it makes sense to be very specific .", Curious to dive deeper
215,I would think so . I suppose it has validity to convey something with just one word that lets everyone know everything about it . I think it might be difficult if you were to use a smell word with person who had never smelled that scent before ., Curious to dive deeper
215,"The Semaq Beri speakers take it seriously , especially with the brother and sister thing . They 'd struggle in the city .", Surprised
215,Ha ! They would indeed . It is funny how different cultures have taboos that make no sense to anyone but them . Whenever I smell a certain perfume I find myself back in time to my school days and the girl I used to love ., Curious to dive deeper
215,"I guess we have the ability to use our noses in the same way , we just do n't have the need . There 's not the peril for us .", Curious to dive deeper
215,"True . Not many furious predators around to threaten us . It might be interesting to know their names for smells and try to correlate them into our culture , would they mean the same or not .", Curious to dive deeper
215,"It seems it very specific to what you do , like the difference between horticulturists and hunter-gatherers .", Curious to dive deeper
215,"Yes , and culture . If I say to you that an object smells like ( ....... ) , you would in all likelihood have a very good idea of what I 'm touch to based on shared experience .", Curious to dive deeper
215,"Avoiding mixing odors seems very extreme , I ca n't imagine cooking at home if I have to use different burner for for_each_one meat .", Surprised
215,That would indeed be a hardship . When I cook I 'm always using the simplest most direct way to get fed . A lot of the time that involves a can and one smoke ., Curious to dive deeper
215,"I wonder what they 'd make of more_or_less of the exotic cuisines like Indian , Thai or Vietnamese cooking .", Neutral
215,"They would be adding to their dictionary I think . Some smells give Maine the willies , like fish . I hate the smell so whenever I walk into someone 's home that has been cooking it I get sick to my stomach , so maybe they are on to something when they do n't mix odors .", Curious to dive deeper
215,"Speaking of fish , did you know there was AN immortal jellyfish ?", Surprised
215,I heard that but wonder how they determined it ?, Curious to dive deeper
215,"Yeah , I guess there make_up no way to prove it . A lot easier to prove a seahorse has a neck", Curious to dive deeper
215,Yes . Maybe the jellyfish in question regenerate itself constantly so they just infer that it 's immortal ., Curious to dive deeper
215,"Another surprising fact is the burning of books by the FDA , I thought the US was against censorship", Surprised
215,I did too . What was the content matter and when did it happen ?, Curious to dive deeper
215,"I have no idea , I 'd shot the thirties or fifties . Some kinds of novels with problematic themes", Curious to dive deeper
215,Probably of a sexual nature . many people seem to think that leads to corruption ., Curious to dive deeper
215,"Well , it was good mouth to you .", Neutral
216,Hello ! Do you like to read ?, Surprised
216,"Hi , yes I like to read both Fiction and not fiction , what about you ?", Happy
216,I 'm into non-fiction more than anything . I wonder what types of books the FDA burned back then ., Surprised
216,"Wow , they real did a big act of censorship , it was six tons of books", Happy
216,That is one big stack of books ! I wish I could have watched the olympic events of literature back in the day !, Curious to dive deeper
216,That is right along with music and painting ! ! And it was until last centuries ! !, Happy
216,That is so crazy ! I did n't even know romantic kissing was a fairly recent development in literature ! Where take I been !, Surprised
216,"Wow , And it was not mentioned frequently in greek literature", Happy
216,"Those storey were still amazing though even without that haha . I wonder if they ever wrote about humans losing their body hair 240,000 years ago ?", Curious to dive deeper
216,LOL who knows ! ! but I found crazy that there is a contest to come up with the worst opening sentence of a novel, Happy
216,I 'm sure there have been many dandies ! I bet Winston Churchill was n't in that since he won a Alfred_Bernhard_Nobel prize in literature ., Surprised
216,Yes he did not earn antiophthalmic_factor peace nobel prize !, Happy
216,You would have thought that is what it was for ! I sometimes wonder what sound frequency causes fear in us ?, Curious to dive deeper
216,"Wow , I guess they use those frequencies in suspense and terror movies ! but did you know we could re-grow a rib", Happy
216,"That is crazy that we can ! I wish we could regrow hair lol , and vitamin C but we ca n't , but everything else can !", Curious to dive deeper
216,"That would be awesome ! The rib we could grow in 2 to 3 months , there must be something to regrow hair , we just have to discover it !", Happy
216,I agree ! We pauperization to get on the immortal life like a breed of jellyfish is !, Surprised
216,"That is amazing ! and about sea creatures , did you know only the seahorse has a neck ?", Happy
216,"That is hard to imagine with all of the breeds out there , just very cool ! Fish are just crazy !", Surprised
216,Did you know that there is a difference how fresh water and salt water fishes drink_in water ?, Happy
216,Is n't it something with osmosis ? I 'm going to look more into that . Have a great day !, Curious to dive deeper
217,How familiar are you with the hunting and gathering culture masses used to have ?, Neutral
217,"Not excessively familiar , Although I 've read a bit from researcher Nicole Kruspe discussing odor .", Curious to dive deeper
217,"Although our sense of smell may not be as developed as some species , odor played an essential role in our survival . However , odor is unique in that people do n't name the specific odor itself , but rather what it reminds us of .", Curious to dive deeper
217,"Interesting . Western scholarly_person dismissed scents as unknowable , or at least unnameable for millenia .", Surprised
217,"True , but recent studies by Majid found that the Jahai , who are hunter gatherers still , are able to identify these odors by abstract names . It seems that these hunter gathers & horticulturalists can identify odors , unlike the rest of their world due to their unique cirucmstances .", Curious to dive deeper
217,"True , Kruspe and Majid propose that , when people settle into , say , horticulture or postindustrial society , other senses become relatively more important than smell .", Surprised
217,"McGann states that this ability to describe the differences in odor receptors would play a greater role in a more natural , wild environment than the secure urban areas that most horicultural people live . While distinquishing complex smells may save a hunter/gather 's life in the wild , it would be as much a life or death situation in most instances in an urban setting . In fact , simple odors like smelling sulfur are enough for most people to avoid dangerous situations .", Curious to dive deeper
217,"Did you know that Humans ( taxonomically , Homo sapiens ) are the only extant members of the subtribe Hominina .", Surprised
217,"I recently read that the defining characteristics of Hominina are bipedal locomotion , high dexterity , complex brains , and complex language .", Curious to dive deeper
217,"Early hominins‚ particularly the australopithecines , whose brains and anatomy are in many ways more similar to ancestral non-human apes‚ are less often referred to as `` human . ''", Surprised
217,"True , but because evolutionary development is progressive , it is diffiult to define cleanly where it is apes stop being apes and became humans instead . Considering some of these early hominins were capable of using fire , displaying high intelligence , I believe they should still be consider humans or at least an early precusor .", Curious to dive deeper
217,"True , they gave rise to anatomically New Homo sapiens in Africa about 315,000 years ago", Happy
217,"Rather than simply anatomy , I believe the social behaviors and communication is what distinguishes modern human . While most early hominins were capable of using tools , homo sapiens were able to use societys for protection and use their advance communication to capture even the most abstract of concepts for the exponential accumulation and spread of knowledge .", Curious to dive deeper
217,"Did you know that If earth 's entire history was viewed as a 24 hour period , humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds .", Sad
217,I sole happened upon that information on a Did you know ? video . What advantages do you believe allowed us to dominate within this small window in history ?, Curious to dive deeper
217,"Advantages that explain this evolutionary success include a relatively larger brain with a particularly well-developed neocortex , prefrontal cortex which enable high levels of abstract reasoning and language", Happy
217,"Although early hominins have similar adaptations , what do you believe made us stand out and survive while the others did n't ?", Curious to dive deeper
217,A silly one is that homo are the only mammals that ca n't breathe and swallow at the same time, Happy
217,What purpose do you think this serves ? Is it to seperate the lungs and stomach to prevent drowning or getting food in the lungs ?, Curious to dive deeper
217,"Perhaps so , although such adaptaptations would be more likely to occur as gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits came to land .", Surprised
217,"Speaking of fish , I recently learned that it follow negatively labeled as a parphyletic group and not a formal taxonoic group since the classification is n't as clear as perhaps mammals .", Curious to dive deeper
217,Fish are pretty amazing . There was a koi fish named hanako that lived for 226 class Thanks for the chat !, Surprised
218,Do you like fish ?, Curious to dive deeper
218,"Yes , I love fish ( at least eating it ) . I find it funny that freshwater fish only `` drink '' water through their skin via osmosis , while saltwater fish also drink water through their mouths .", Happy
218,"I like to eat them too , and that is funny , have you heard of the melanise swallower fish before ?", Curious to dive deeper
218,"Well , I 've heard that they can eat prey twice their length and ten times their weight , so they must be quite substantial .", Neutral
218,"i agree and also a scary species , they seem like quite the predator", Curious to dive deeper
218,"Yeah , for sure ! I also found it interesting that a seahorse is the only fish to have a neck . I did n't even know it represent a kind of fish .", Neutral
218,The only one ? reallly ? that is suprising I though most fish had a neck, Curious to dive deeper
218,"Actually , I think what we take for a fish 's neck ( I 've made this mistake also ) is not really a neck , but more the area where their gills come out . I find it interesting also that 84 per cent of genes known to be associated with human diseases have counterparts in the zebrafish .", Neutral
218,"Sounds like a fish we have to study a lot more closely , they can be the solution to many of our health problems and the immortal jellyfish", Curious to dive deeper
218,"Yeah , for sure ! It 's kind of funny actually , because they said that in humans , that if a human has a rib surgically shortened , that he/she buttocks regrow a rib equally as strong as the original within only 2-3 months .", Happy
218,"Humans are just amazing , we adapt for persistnace and we are the best distance runners in all the animal kingdom", Curious to dive deeper
218,"Yeah , for sure ! Humans do have their downfalls though , because they can not synthesize their own vitamin c like animals and plants can .", Neutral
218,"I guess its a great thing we know how to appy skill ,", Curious to dive deeper
218,"Yeah , for sure ! One thing that humans have going for them however is their creativity . Did you know that there is an annual literature contest that challenges writers to come up with the worst possible opening sentence to a novel ? That 's really funny .", Neutral
218,"I didnt know that , do you like to read ? it does sound like a funny contest", Curious to dive deeper
218,"Yes , I love reading . It 's kind of funny , because architecture , literature , music , painting and sculptures were olympic events from 1912 until 1952 . I do n't know why those would be considered sports , but that is quite interesting .", Surprised
218,"It is interesting , never considered as sports either , do you know who Winston Churchill was ?", Curious to dive deeper
218,"Yes , atomic_number_2 was the British Prime Minister during WWII and in 1953 he won a nobel prize , ironically though , it was in literature and not peace .", Surprised
218,I didnt know him as much of a writter but I haver to read some of his novels and works, Curious to dive deeper
218,"Yeah , he voice like an interesting guy . It 's kind of curious though , because it has been said that romantic kissing is a fairly recent development and is rarely mentioned even in ancient greek literature . How can they explain Romeo and Juliet then ? That one had a lot of kissing on the lips .", Neutral
218,"Yeah one that over with two deaths and poison , hope you have a nice night .", Curious to dive deeper
219,"Hi there , , do you have group_A favorite instrument ?", Curious to dive deeper
219,"Hi there , I do I love the guitar and the piano . How around you ?", Curious to dive deeper
219,Yes I love the piano too . Once the BBC bring music as they felt they did not have important news, Curious to dive deeper
219,Wow that follow impressive . Freddie Mercury and McCarthy also played piano too, Curious to dive deeper
219,"yea and they played the same piano once , freedie for bohemian rhapsody and mccarthy for hey jude", Curious to dive deeper
219,Nice that is pretty cool . Have you heard of circus galop ?, Curious to dive deeper
219,Yeah that is the stress testing song for pianos that humans can not play, Curious to dive deeper
219,There exist a piano that sits on top of the highest mountain in the UK, Curious to dive deeper
219,Oh that must be the one that the climbing_iron found when they were hiking up there, Curious to dive deeper
219,"Yes that is the one . Do you ever_so shop online , like on Amazon ?", Curious to dive deeper
219,I do actually . Did you know Jeff work_up a clock on a mountain ?, Curious to dive deeper
219,"Yes and it is supposed to run for 10 000 years . AMazon owns IMDB , pretty cool", Curious to dive deeper
219,They are everywhere now . And they have a deal with US Postal Service to deliver on Sundays, Curious to dive deeper
219,That is so convenient . And their workers seem to be really busy wholly day long, Curious to dive deeper
219,"Yes they can walk anywhere between 7-15 miles , that is a lot of steps", Curious to dive deeper
219,That sure is . Have you ever bought from AmazonBasics ?, Curious to dive deeper
219,"I have , I know they are supposed to be on the lower end but I find their stuff to be pretty good too", Curious to dive deeper
219,"iodin agree , it is pretty good . The first guy to buy on amazon got a building named after him", Curious to dive deeper
219,Yes and all he had to do was spend less than $ 30 . What a contribution, Curious to dive deeper
219,yea pretty awesome for him . Do you like animals ?, Curious to dive deeper
219,"I do , my favorite are dogs but I also like others like cats , snakes , elephants and such", Happy
220,"Hello Friend , do you like baseball ?", Curious to dive deeper
220,"Yea , I 'm a hugh Yankees fan , I never knew a 17 year old female pitcher once struck out Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig then got banned , sounds like they signed her", Surprised
220,"Yes , did you know that baseball managers represent uniforms because they are technically able to play for their teams if the need arises ?", Curious to dive deeper
220,I did n't know that was the reason why managers wore uniforms but I 've heard of mangers playing In the game on rare occasions, Neutral
220,"Yes , did you also know that a man found $ trinity Million worth of 1900 's baseball cards in his grandfather 's attic hidden there since the 1940s ?", Curious to dive deeper
220,"No that 's crazy , I wonder if they let cards of players on the 1908 World Series winning Cubs", Curious to dive deeper
220,That could be . Did you also know that kickball make_up also called soccer-baseball in Canada ?, Curious to dive deeper
220,"No , that 's an odd name . Did you know in baseball if a player catches a ball in their hat the opposing team gets deuce-ace bases instead of being out ?", Curious to dive deeper
220,"That 's cool . Did you love that after the Chicago Cubs won the 2016 World Series , over 5 million people celebrated in the streets , making it one of the largest gatherings in human history ?", Curious to dive deeper
220,"No but I 'm not surprised , it had exist 108 years since the Cubs last won a world series", Neutral
220,"Yes , and the Chicago Cubs were the first baseball team to win back-to-back world series , and did n't win again until 2016 .", Curious to dive deeper
220,"ace never knew the Cubs used to be named the Orphans , I wonder why they were called that", Curious to dive deeper
220,"Not sure but I know that the Chicago Cubs and the Atlanta Braves are the two oldest teams in the major league baseball , both having been founded the same yr as the Battle of the Little Bighorn .", Curious to dive deeper
220,"Interesting , I ne'er knew the Cubs had pitchers with 4 and 6 fingers on their pitching hand , I wonder if those features gave them an advantage", Neutral
220,"I 'm not sure but in 1945 , the Chicago Cubs baseball team was `` cursed '' when the stadium security would n't let a man named Billy Sianis stay inch a World Series stadium with his smelly pet goat . The cubs did not play in a World Series again until 2016 .", Curious to dive deeper
220,"Lol , spooky . Did you know that the Dodgers lost the most world series than whatsoever other team ?", Curious to dive deeper
220,"Yes , did you know that axerophthol of 2018 the World Series has been contested 114 times ?", Curious to dive deeper

220,Fascinating . Did you know that in the 1992 World Series that the US Marine Corps color guard carried the Canada sword_lily into the stadium upside down ?, Curious to dive deeper

222,nobelium I did when I was younger but lost interest . How bout you ?, Curious to dive deeper
222,Every once in a while . It 's one of those sports I would rather play than watch . The Japanese are such big fans of baseball that they would probably take the name `` national pastime '' from the Americans if they could, Neutral
222,Yea they are usually storm to find so many americans like it too ., Neutral
222,Enough that people used to collect baseball cards . One man found a collection in his grandfather 's attic that was worth three million dollars, Neutral
222,thats a lot of money . are any managers notice worth anything ? they do wear the uniform after all ., Curious to dive deeper
222,"Probably only if they step in and play the game . I 've never seen any of them do it , but that would be an interest thing to see", Curious to dive deeper
222,"I think that would be fun to see , like the cubs winning the championship after 108 years .", Happy
222,"It would be fun to see them all play kickball sometime . In Canada , they call the game soccer-baseball", Neutral
222,I dont think A couple would schedule all 2430 games throughout 24 years for soccer baseball . like one couple did for baseball ., Neutral

223,"I 'm sure you can , might cost more than $ 27.95 , that was the amount spent by the first customer on Amazon .", Curious to dive deeper
223,"I heard that person got a building named after them , that would be awesome , and definitely worth the 28 dollars . I ca n't believe Amazon started IN 1994", Curious to dive deeper
223,"For sure , started as a book store . The USPS has a contract to deliver Amazon packages on Sunday . You guess Amazon is getting too big ?", Curious to dive deeper
223,"I think Amazon has gotten so big , but I think in a good way . I just hope they turn into a monopoly .", Curious to dive deeper
223,"For sure , they kind of already are . Or at least selling all that cheap stuff kind of hurts the market overall . The warehouse workers work a ton , between 7 and 15 miles a day they walk .", Surprised
223,I could n't imagine take_the_air that much per day . I would be in the best shape of my life . Did you know that amazon has another site that sells their returned goods at a discount, Curious to dive deeper

226,Me too . I think its too much money for a player that has proven himself . He is a 28 years old and he plays in the first base position and he did very well as a Royal ., Curious to dive deeper
226,By the end of that deal he will be in his mid to late 30 's and nowhere ear as good . Definitely an overpay . Not as wild as those Machado and Harper deals for over 300 million though ., Neutral

262,"It was before youtube . Probably , you can not find IT online .", Curious to dive deeper
262,"Yeah , that is too bad . he was probably antiophthalmic_factor real ladies man too . Tupac was also a great dancer .", Neutral

263,"I 'm not to familiar with the Wiz , is that based on the Wizard of Oz ?", Curious to dive deeper
263,"Yes , it has much different music ( e.g. , funk and disco ) . The movie had Michael Jackson . It does n't have the song `` Be a Lion . ''", Curious to dive deeper
263,"I 've heard the Wiz as being described axerophthol weird , from the description I tend to agree", Neutral
263,It is kind of weird ... The music and the dancing are at the core . You might remember the song `` Ease on kill the Road . '', Curious to dive deeper
263,"Maybe but not that I think of it the normal Wizard of Oz is weird , like really weird so I guess the Wiz should be weird too", Neutral
263,"There is a big cultural difference between the two , like a farm in M vs. Detroit . Funny , it is at the Ford Theater in D.C .", Curious to dive deeper
263,"fording Theater , is n't that were Lincoln was assassinated ?", Curious to dive deeper
263,Yep . I did n't realize it was still a theater . I would have imagined it as a museum . The tag are $ 20- $ 73 ., Curious to dive deeper
263,"I guess $ 20- $ 73 for tickets is n't a bad price , if the Wiz is performed near me maybe I 'll check it out", Neutral
263,I may see the Black Panther . I guess he is the richest of all superheros with $ 500B . Tony staring and Bruce Wayne are n't even close ., Curious to dive deeper
263,"Nope , I hear Chadwick Boseman did a great job a T'Challa , he was great in Civil War", Neutral
263,I do n't even remember it being a comic book . I wonder if people confused it with the radical civil rights group under the same name ?, Curious to dive deeper
263,I used to think Black Panther was named later the group but I guess the comic came out before the group, Surprised
263,Interesting . Now I 'm wondering it the civil rights group got their name from the comic ? They shift the name to `` Black Leopard '' -- does n't sound as cool ., Surprised
263,"Nope , black leopard sounds sort_of lame", Neutral
263,I did n't realize Siri was intended for Android until Apple bought it hostel 2010 ., Surprised
263,"Me neither . I personally find Siri creepy , especially when it sings the same song as hal 9000", Fearful
263,Yikes ! Hal creeps me out . It 's like picturing Tupac atomic_number_33 a ballet dancer . I guess he did that in high school . I ca n't see that ..., Fearful
263,"Well I stimulate to go , nice chatting with you", Neutral
264,"Did you ever think around how celebrities in science are rarer than in music , film , sport , and politics ?", Surprised

264,"Yes , single agree , he was brilliant as well . He was the ultimate example of mind over matter .", Curious to dive deeper
264,he was one of the first people to apply quantum physics to black holes and make predictions with a process named after him as `` Hawking radiation '', Curious to dive deeper
264,Yeah his understanding and explicate of quantum physics and other matter is incredible ., Curious to dive deeper
264,"I do n't really understand what helium understood because it seems so foreign to me , but he also had a lot of wit as well to share with the world .", Happy
264,"Yeah I am the same , it is very complex stuff . There are scientists who theorize that universes evolve through natural survival like species do here .", Curious to dive deeper
264,Hawking was very active up until the end of life even travelling and lecturing internationally . I have to give credit as well to his supporters, Curious to dive deeper
264,Yeah I agree with you there . I guess there is a radical theory that there is only one electron in the universe ! I 'm sure Hawking would have disagreed ., Curious to dive deeper
264,"Probably . Also , there is a region of infinite maybe pulling galaxies outside the observable universe . There must be so much out there .", Surprised
264,"Wow , yeah information_technology is wild to think about the universe as a whole in general .", Surprised
264,Strange but there ar some stars that are cold enough that they can be touched by a human hand, Surprised
264,"That is a strange fact , very cool . Did you know that Kim jong-un has a degree in physics ?", Curious to dive deeper
264,"Not sure who that is , but iodin wonder if Hawkings would validate the tidbit that the universe could have come from nothing without violating physics ?", Curious to dive deeper
264,I 'm not sure that is AN interesting thought and he is the leader of North Korea ., Curious to dive deeper
264,Oh wow ! Robin Williams in aladdin was the first actor to start the trend of celebrity voicings of animated film characters ., Curious to dive deeper
264,I did n't know that . I venture Pixas spent 3 years studying the physics of curly hair in order to get merida 's hair in brave right ., Curious to dive deeper
264,"People answer n't realize how much time is spent on these details . Judge Judy makes a heap of money at $ 123,000 per episode being highest paid celebrity behind Lebron James", Surprised
264,holy cow that is so much an episode . I wonder how much other tv people make ., Curious to dive deeper
264,"I do n't know , but I guess not as much . Carol Burnett was the first celebrity on benny Street : )", Surprised
265,Do you know who Stephen Hawking is ?, Curious to dive deeper
265,"Hello , yes I do . I actually just recently watched a movie about him as well . The Theory Of Everything , very well done and explained a lot about his life .", Curious to dive deeper
265,"Interesting , I 've seen that one too . Did you know a lot of his work is around blackholes ?", Curious to dive deeper
265,Yes . Did you hump that the deepest note in the universe is emitted by a black hole !, Curious to dive deeper
265,IT would n't surprise me . I think a lot of his work was around the Event Horizon 's if I remember correctly ., Curious to dive deeper
265,If you fold_up a paper in half 103 times it would be as thick as the observable universe !, Curious to dive deeper
265,Somehow I do n't believe that ., Curious to dive deeper
265,"Ok. Thats cool . I have no idea if thats true , something I read recently in some cool facts . This is no where near my area of expertise . I did read that there may be a universe inside the black hole though , is n't that crazy !", Curious to dive deeper
265,"Yeah , they have a lot of wacky ideas about the universe . That much I do know . They also propose it make_up a hologram .", Curious to dive deeper
265,I also read that the universe used to be opaque due to there embody too much plasma that light could not travel through it ., Curious to dive deeper
265,"Yeah , I 've read that as well . There be stars in the universe that are cold enough to be touched by humans .", Curious to dive deeper
265,"Thats really cool . I ca n't imagine touching a star . Have you ever heard of a hubble telescope ? Apparently it discovered a galaxy so big it should n't exist , according to physics .", Curious to dive deeper
265,"Yeah , that live pretty cool . I know a lot about Hubble , it is a pretty cool telescope .", Curious to dive deeper
265,Sounds ilk it !, Curious to dive deeper
265,"Yeah , I remember when they did the space walk to fix it , remember that ?", Curious to dive deeper
265,I do not . Was that recently ?, Curious to dive deeper
265,"It was about 15 yr ago , apparently the hubble is having problems again .", Curious to dive deeper
265,I see . Guess they in_truth need to make some upgrades . A lot in technology has changed in years, Curious to dive deeper
265,"Yeah , IT does . Pretty bad , the hubble can see a lot of things .", Curious to dive deeper
265,Did you cognize turbulence is one of physics great mysteries ?, Curious to dive deeper

266,"Hi , how are you ?", Neutral
266,"Good , how are you ? Celebrities in scientific_discipline are quite rare are n't they ? I was a fan of Stephen Hawking . I 'm sad he finally passed away from ALS .", Sad
266,"He was tremendous thinker . Gosh , I wonder if he was as smart as Kim Jong-un , who give_birth a degree in physics , supposedly .", Neutral
266,I would think that he is smarter . I wonder how it felt to have such a physical disability but yet such a sharp mind ., Sad
266,"In his younger years , he was n't badly afflicted . I wonder whether he was one of the scientists who theorize that cosmos evolve through natural selection", Curious to dive deeper
266,"Hmm , it would n't surprise me . Hawking live further than Einstein did on understanding of gravity . Hawking developed new graphical methods that let him visualize physics of light paths in warped space , black holes , and the convulsions of the universe .", Surprised
266,And he did all that while battling ALS . There is a theory that there is only one electron in the universe . Does this make any sense ? I wonder who came up with that ., Surprised
266,"Hmm , it does not to me but I know I 'm not much of a scientific mind . Hawking strengthened the Big Bang theory as well that says that the galaxies were in a compressed area smaller than a single mote before the big bang .", Curious to dive deeper
266,"Hard to imagine , but I guess the mathematics supports it . The universe could have come from nothing without violating physics . Particles can pop in and out of existence , so I guess a universe worth could as well .", Neutral
266,"Yeah , it 's hard for me to relate to scientists and all of their elaborate theories but Hawking was blessed with wit . He was quite the jokester , which makes him identical relatable .", Happy
266,I think he took to his celebrity status quite well . Pixar studio has a secret room that is visited often by celebrities . I wonder if Hawking ever got a chance to see it ., Curious to dive deeper
266,"Speaking of celebrity , did you know that Judge Judy is the highest paid celebrity after lebron james ?", Curious to dive deeper
266,The woman is a legend . Over $ 100k per episode . Probably a longer career too . But she probably has n't done any recreate voice work ., Neutral
266,I guess celebrities doing voice work is a fairly new thing in terms of history . Robin Williams was the first to start the trend of celebrities doing animated film voices . This was for the movie Aladdin ., Surprised
266,Did he ever appear on Sesame Street ? Carol Burnett was the showtime celebrity to appear on the children 's series . He would have been great on that show !, Neutral

266,"I think he 'll have a positive impact . in_any_event , I enjoyed chatting with you .", Neutral

274,There cost no salary cap in baseball and they have all of the money . They should cap it like the NFL does ., Neutral

276,Looking at some of the managers today I think it 's more of a tradition now . I know in the past there were a few times where there were actual player/coaches . I trust Ted Williams was one ., Surprised
276,I found it very surprising that a married couple had been scheduling all 2430 major league baseball games up until 2005 . I figured it was just a figurer ., Surprised
276,Baseball is deep into it 's tradition . They probably did n't worry about any form of software until it became too perplex ., Curious to dive deeper
276,"You 're right . That 's probably why baseball cards are so popular too , tradition . A man found 3 million dollars worth of baseball cards in his grandpa attic .", Surprised
276,"Also the market was not as saturated back then as it is today , now so many different companies make cards that on_that_point is n't a chance for them to be as rare .", Neutral
276,I never knew that is why the old ones are so valuable . I thought it was simply the popularity of the player . In Japan baseball is so popular fans do not realize it is actually America 's pastime . I wonder what their baseball cards go for ., Curious to dive deeper
276,It 's interesting when a Japanese player wants to play in the MLB . The team gets money for that player leaving ., Neutral
276,I answer not know that . In Canada kickball is called soccer-baseball . Odd how a different country views baseball ., Surprised
276,I wonder if they have any different rules than we do ? It would be interesting to see if they put their own twist on the stake ., Curious to dive deeper
276,"When I think of baseball , I think of countries like Japan and America . I do n't really think of Canada and single especially do not think of the Ottoman Empire which were still in existence the last time the Chicago Cubs won the world series .", Surprised
276,"It 's also rattling popular in Latin America . A lot of professional players are from Cuba , Puerto Rico , The Dominican Republic , and Venezuela .", Neutral
276,That is true . I suppose Canada does have influence because in the 1992 humans series the US Marine Corps color guard brought in the Canadian flag upside down ., Surprised
276,That must have been embarrassing . Hopefully everyone realized it was a mistake !, Curious to dive deeper
276,Well if Babe Ruth was caught stealing to end game 7 and lose the 1926 world series with his team down by one run and everyone still loves him then I am sure it is okay about the flag all those years later ., Surprised

278,"It did ? Wow , that constitute suprising , womans sports usually dont get support at all", Curious to dive deeper
278,yes as little as foreign sports ! During the 92 series the us marines carried the canada flag into the stadium upside down !, Curious to dive deeper
278,"I wonder why , do you know the intellect for that ?", Curious to dive deeper
278,An accident I think ! They were clueless . I hate the Yankees because they win so much . exercise you like them ?, Surprised

279,"that is interesting , do you think they ever recreate in a game ?", Curious to dive deeper
279,"I do n't think so , I do n't watch too much baseball and I do n't collect cards either , but I might reconsider seeing how valuable they are when a man found three meg dollars worth of cards in his grandfather 's attic !", Surprised
279,"single had heard about that , imagine being set for life overnight like that !", Curious to dive deeper

279,Yeah that 's a little frightening and do they mean `` lost '' as in lost his way because of the fame or `` lost '' as in missing ?, Curious to dive deeper
279,"I am not sure , I just know there is a lost one . I heard once they suspended mattingly because he would not get a haircut", Curious to dive deeper
279,The players to don a certain haircut ? That 's pretty strict ! I wonder whether or not people still try to sneak into those games like what Bill O ' Reilly did with the bogus press pass . That 's pretty smart since computers and photoshop did n't seem to be too popular back then ., Happy
279,"That is true , you can get away with vitamin_A lot back then , now we know too much !", Curious to dive deeper
279,"Yeah , have you ever been to antiophthalmic_factor live game ?", Curious to dive deeper

280,"It is one of the few sports in which the player scores points , not a ball or puck.I wonder how much each baseball costs to make .", Neutral
280,"thats a good question , but you could buy a lot fo baseballs if you found millions of dollars worth of cards in your attic like that one guy", Surprised
280,He must have wondered why his grandfather did n't do anything with them . I would sell or_so and keep some ., Neutral
280,"ya kind of a bum move to sel all your grandpas cards , especially since theyve been there since 1940", Surprised

280,They must have had a computer to help them . All those games ? It could n't be done on newspaper_publisher ., Neutral
280,"ya I agree , like 2500 games to schedule a year , that would get tedius !", Surprised
280,"I wonder how much they got paid . The Cubs have n't had much luck , have they . They were the first baseball team to win back-to-back world series ; and have n't won since .", Neutral
280,"no you 're right , what do you think about the Yankees ?", Curious to dive deeper
280,"They have too much money . In general , thither is too much superstition in baseball . Ben Affleck caused the production of Gone Girl to shut down for 4 days because he refused to wear a Yankees cap on screen .", Neutral
280,its funny they started KO'd as the Highlanders but changed their name in 1913, Surprised
280,The Yankees is a very American name . Their logo comes from a medal designed for a police officer ., Neutral
280,"oh thats cool , wild that they have the 2nd highest attendance in the league !", Surprised

281,habitation runs make the game more exciting !, Surprised
281,"Yep , 7 of the playoffs teams in the division round were in the top 10 for Home Runs go season", Neutral
281,That is amazing . I just learned that baseball managers wear uniforms because they are technically able to play for their teams if the need arises ., Surprised
281,Yea I remember Pete Rose played a few games while as a manager, Neutral
281,I have never heard that before . I always thought it was funny to reckon the managers dressed up ., Curious to dive deeper
281,"I wonder if baseball managers in Japan ever play , apparently Japanese fans are surprised to find out baseball is considered America 's pasttime", Neutral
281,I wonder why they are surprised by that ?, Curious to dive deeper
281,"I guess Japan really loves baseball lol , I wonder if they have valuable cards similar the one worth 3 million dollars found in a grandfather 's attic", Curious to dive deeper
281,I wonder if its newly popular or if IT been there for awhile ., Surprised
281,"I do n't know , it 's funny the ottoman empire was still in existence the last time the Cubs come_through the World Series", Surprised
281,I like there was a date to reference ., Surprised
281,I believe it was 1908 before the Baltimore Orioles moved to NY and were rename the Yankees, Neutral

282,"I make_out he was suspended but not for that long , what team is he on now ?", Surprised
282,I believe the Astros, Curious to dive deeper
282,"Oh , I knew he was on the blue jays , that 's a pretty high risk trade considering Osuna violated the domestic violence policy", Neutral
282,Yes . Apparently the Yankees trade with the Reds for Chapman before the 2016 season when Chapman was set to dish a suspension for a domestic abuse incident is similar, Surprised
282,"Yea , I remember that , although Chapman is a great closer I wish the Yankees would n't of traded for him in 2016 due to his incidents", Disgusted
282,It seems risky . just the Astros seemed to want a late-inning reliever badly enough to get Osuna, Surprised
282,"Yea , as former world series champions they started to get worried they only had a 4 game lead in their division", Neutral
282,Did you know that a get_hitched_with couple scheduled all the major league games for 24 years up until 2005, Curious to dive deeper

282,A man found $ 3 million in baseball cards in his grandfather 's attic, Surprised
282,I 'm surprised they were still in good condition after being hidden since the 1940s, Surprised
282,"Yes , I wish I found them . Interestingly speaking of baseball it says that in 1973 two yankee pitchers switched families permanently . I wonder what that means ?", Surprised
282,"I 'm not sure either , maybe they both divorced their wives and then married them", Curious to dive deeper
282,In August 1991 Don Mattingly was actually suspended for not getting a haircut . I wonder if they still enforce that rule ?, Surprised
282,"It 's possible , I know they made Johnny Damon cut his hair and shave his beard when he signed with the yankees", Neutral
282,"Wow . Interestingly , the woman 's cosmos cup had higher TV ratings than the world series in the U.S. That is cool .", Surprised
282,"That 's cool , I think that exist the year the US women won the world cup", Neutral
282,great ! The ottoman empire was still around when the Chicago Cubs last won the world series ., Surprised
282,"Lol , I think they need to update that fact unless the ottoman empire made a resurgence a couple years ago", Neutral
283,So how bout them Yankees ?, Curious to dive deeper
283,How are they doing ?, Happy
283,They are perennially amoung the leaders in the MLB attendance and made the post season 2 old_age in a row, Happy
283,Do you believe that Osuna has served group_A 75 game suspension due to domestic violence, Happy
283,"That 's sick , I do n't know what the Astro 's were thinking taking the trade from the Blue Jays", Surprised
283,I wonder why he 's allowed rearwards, Angry
283,one guess it 's his first offense and they are waiting to find out about his upcoming court hearing, Curious to dive deeper
283,oh . the Astros think Osuna is remorseful and had enough counseling to not harm anyone in baseball I guess, Curious to dive deeper
283,I guess they are devote him a `` fresh start '' which means as long as he plays good we do n't care, Angry
283,He says he wo n't let them down ., Surprised
283,"If they are serious of giving him a fresh start they should wait till future year , he has n't pitched in the majors since May 6 anyway", Neutral
283,The trade left the Astros in a sticky situation . All that money invested and what return yet, Curious to dive deeper
283,"I heard the Nationals might trade Bryce Harper , maybe Houston should have tried to get him instead", Curious to dive deeper
283,They power need him, Curious to dive deeper
283,he 's good but not as good as Aaron Judge though, Neutral
283,Hopefully Aaron Judge will not be out for more than 3 week, Curious to dive deeper
283,"Yea , he 's the front of the franchise now since Jeter left", Curious to dive deeper
283,Did you know the Northerner had been the Highlanders ?, Curious to dive deeper

284,"I know a bit , I tend to follow some of the games and I think that it was a good call , baseball is an interesting sport so , many cool facts about the game", Curious to dive deeper
284,"oh ya for sure , like how the MLB uses 160k balls in a given year for all their games", Surprised
284,"Thats a lot of balls , just like a single couple used to schedule all of the 2430 games of the league , seems like a lot of hard work", Curious to dive deeper
284,"that does seem like a lot of work , did you hear that a 17 year old girl struck out sister Ruth , I wonder what happened to her", Curious to dive deeper
284,Really ? a 17 yr old struck out one of the greatest players of the history of the game ! ! ! thats crazy ! !, Curious to dive deeper
284,"yup , she should have gone pro , do you know what happens if youre in the outfield and catch a ball with your hat in baseball ?", Curious to dive deeper
284,"No , what happens if you do that ?", Curious to dive deeper
284,"well you apparently fix 3 bases , I never knew that", Surprised
284,"Really ? I wonder why it doesnt happen often , I havent seen it , that would be interesting to see though .", Curious to dive deeper
284,"nope I think they should do that more , do you like the Yankees ?", Curious to dive deeper
284,"I think they are a great team , the team_up has a lot of history for sure , do you like them ?", Curious to dive deeper
284,"I do actually , they win a lot and I like winning teams haha , I guess they were created in 1901", Surprised
284,"Its a winning team for sure lol , you know that in 1973 pitchers just swapped families permanently , that seems really odd", Curious to dive deeper
284,"haha wow that is odd , pretty dense how Ben Affleck refused to wear a Yankees hat because he was a red sox fan", Surprised
284,"It does seem dumb but I guess I can respect that , he must feel identified with his team , you know that a player produce suspended because he refused to get a haircut ! !", Curious to dive deeper
284,"wow that seems slow ! kind of weird that their uniform does n't put names on the backs , they say it takes away the attention from the team", Surprised
284,yea so what do you think about the World Series ? its been played for more than a hundred years a lot of history there, Curious to dive deeper
284,"ya I do n't watch it but I 'm glad its there , I guess its ya been going on since close_to 1903", Curious to dive deeper
284,"Yeah since the year 1903 , its been a long time for sure , the Chicago Cubs were the first team to win it back to back ,", Curious to dive deeper
284,"yup and then they did n't win it for like 70 years or something , I guess the Dodgers have lost more world series than any other team which also stinks haha", Surprised
285,Do you like baseball ?, Curious to dive deeper
285,I do like baseball . I ca n't wait for the season to start . Do you like baseball ? Did you know that it evolved from a game in England ?, Neutral
285,"I do like the game , yeah , and no I didnt know that , I wonder why its not popular in England then", Curious to dive deeper

285,"It is odd , maybe as odd type_A the managers wearing uniforms in the field ,", Curious to dive deeper
285,I 've always wondered why they do that . I assume it 's to show team membership but I do n't really know ., Neutral
285,"Its because they can also play if they think its the best thing , if the need arises they can step into th field , did you hear about that man that found 3 million dollars deserving of cards in his attic", Curious to dive deeper
285,"hence a manager can play ? I did n't know that . If we are talking about the same man he found old baseball cards , right ?", Neutral
285,"Yeah he found card that belonged to his grand father , they were just hidden in the attic , half-baked luck right !", Curious to dive deeper

285,So you said you liked baseball so maybe like the Yankees ? what are your thought on the team, Curious to dive deeper
285,"I like the Yankees . There 's some odd stuff with them though . I mingy , did you hear about the two pitchers that swapped families permanently back in 1973 ?", Neutral
285,"I didnt , why would they do that lol , that is really odd I have to Google that", Surprised
285,It is really odd but I guess it was the 70s so who roll_in_the_hay . I 've even heard there is a '' lost '' yankees player . That is especially odd to me ., Neutral
285,"What does that even_out mean , a `` lost '' Yankees player ? can you elaborate more about it", Curious to dive deeper
285,"I really ca n't , sorry . I just heard that one thing , a lost player . No one ever expanded on it to me .", Neutral
285,"OH I see , well nothing Google cant solve then , you know a player got suspended because he refused to take a haircut", Curious to dive deeper
285,No I did n't ! What player ?, Neutral
285,"His name was don Mattingly , crazy right , that happened back in the year 1991", Curious to dive deeper
285,"You know , I would have thought it would have been much longer ago than that . I guess atomic_number_53 just figured there were stricter rules on hair back in the day .", Neutral
285,"I guess so , still sounds a bit stupid to suspend a player just because of that , I think he was a key player for the team hence yeah .", Curious to dive deeper
286,Hi there ! Are you angstrom baseball fan ?, Curious to dive deeper
286,Not really . I find the sport unmanageable to watch and slow . What about you ?, Neutral

286,I wonder why they call it that . 1 'm always wondered why baseball managers wear uniforms ... I guess they can play for their teams if needed . Interesting ., Happy
286,Do you know who the baseball player Angel Hernandez is ?, Curious to dive deeper
286,He make_up actually an umpire . He has a bad reputation for blowing calls ., Happy
286,That 's what I heard . And he examine to accuse the Yankees and Joe Torre of discrimination against him . I think being an umpire must be difficult, Curious to dive deeper
286,I would n't want to be one . Especially the ref in the NFL who blew that call against the Saints and cost them a chance of going to the super bowl . You 'll have to google it if you do n't know about it ., Surprised
286,I heard about that in the news . Same thing with being a ref in a tennis match or a soccer match . It 's a tough job . At least there is video playback . But human error plays a roll always ., Curious to dive deeper
286,It does . Did you know that baseball is really democratic in Japan too ?, Curious to dive deeper

286,Wow ! Well soccer is an easier game to watch than baseball ., Surprised
286,It is . More action . I wonder if they have hair length rules in soccer ? Don Mattingly of the Yankees once got suspended because he refused to get a haircut . lol, Happy
286,"I do n't think so in soccer . Many of the men have long hair . Remember Alexi Lalas with the long hair ? Speaking of baseball , did you know a female pitched was once booted from MLB for striking out Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig ?", Curious to dive deeper
286,You 're right ! A circle of them tie their hair back . I did n't know that . How interesting ! It 's been fun chatting with you !, Surprised

288,"yes , Babe tried to steal second base and it did not work out well", Curious to dive deeper
288,"No it did n't work well at all . The Cubs equal the first team to win the WS back to back , I guess that didnt work for them either", Curious to dive deeper
288,And that was the live_on time they won until 2016 . Quite the long layoff, Happy
288,"Yeah , it seems like the team had a real_number curse on top of them , the Woman 's World Cup had a higher rating that the World Series .", Curious to dive deeper
288,"Well the World Cup does just come around every 4 years , so I can see how it would be popular on TV", Curious to dive deeper
288,I guess that makes sense still World Series is really pop in the states and woman 's soccer team arent as popular ., Curious to dive deeper
288,Well baseball is not as popular as it was back in the day . Too many things are competing for viewers time, Curious to dive deeper
288,"I guess its not , there are a lot of sports out there , I do like the Yankees and the history the team has", Curious to dive deeper

289,I 'm not sure . It has me thinking about the time my mom threw away my card assemblage ., Curious to dive deeper
289,"Oh , hopefully no good ones . Is n't it funny that soccer-baseball is the name for kickball in Canada .", Surprised
289,"Yeah , that is pretty funny . Is it adenine big sport up there ?", Curious to dive deeper
289,I Am no sure . I know in Japan baseball is super popular ., Happy

289,I know ! That shocks me too ., Neutral
289,Are you a fan of the World Series ?, Curious to dive deeper
289,"yes , I am . As a Cubs fan it has been difficult . Prior to the 2016 win the Ottoman Empire was still in existence the last time they won .", Surprised

290,"That is crazy ! my computer has a lot more juice than that , unbelievable how tech advances .", Surprised
290,I know ! I ca n't imagine not having computers now since we have learned to depend on them so much ., Neutral
290,"We sure_enough do , I have an apple computer , I didnt know smoking near it would make my warranty void .", Surprised
290,Really ? I did n't know that . back in 1936 some russians actually made a computer that ran on water .... how unusual is that ., Surprised
290,"Really strange , I wonder what come_about to that model ? maybe water wasnt the best choice .", Curious to dive deeper
290,"Right ! I do n't even know how that would work . Very interesting though , also I read someone built a 16 bit computer using nothing but Minecraft building blocks , so crazy how these people get these idea 's .", Surprised

290,That odd considering the news giant BBC is today ! did you know that Freddy Mercury played the same piano as Paul McCartney, Happy
290,"My thoughts exactly ! Oh wow that 's an interesting fact ! They built a piano for the Hindenburg and it only weighed over 300 pounds , who would think of putting ampere piano on that airship !", Happy
290,"That takes some useful weight out of the plane , and maybe someone that is a rattling piano fan , would be nice to listen to it in the sky though .", Surprised
290,"Very true . Piano music is great no matter where you are . It is like poetry to your ears , which I love also . I write some poetry and it 's a great stress reliever : )", Happy
290,"I do like poetry , do you like the series of Lord of the Rings ? most of the hobbits names are in_reality names of poetry .", Happy
290,Oh wow I did n't realize that . I think it 's crazy that Edgar Allan Poe only got paid 9 shoot for his famous poem The Raven . Not enough people realize how amazing poetry is ., Surprised
290,"That follow crazy as its one of the most remembered poems of history , it must be worth millions now a days .", Surprised

291,represent n't in by Bartolomeo Cristofori around the year 1700 in Italy ?, Curious to dive deeper
291,That is correct . The piano is being playing using a keyboard that has a words of keys that the pianist presses down to cause the hammers to strike the strings ., Surprised
291,"That is one interesting fact ! You know what is more interest though , how computers have come about !", Surprised
291,I agree . Computers are more complex than pianos in my opinion because they embody devices that carry sequences by computer programming ., Curious to dive deeper
291,Well said ! I wish I could have used a computer that used water to running_game it like the Russians did !, Curious to dive deeper
291,Really ! ! I did n't know that the Russians did this . Do you know who wrote the first computer algorithm ?, Surprised
291,No ane do n't ! Who was it ?, Surprised
291,It was by a woman list Ada Lovelace ., Curious to dive deeper
291,Oh cool ! I wonder if she wanted to upload her mind to a computer like other transhumanists want to !, Curious to dive deeper
291,Would n't that be cool Ha ! ! ! Do you know by any chance what was the number one installed piece of software on computers in 1995 ?, Happy
291,Was it something like Solitaire ?, Curious to dive deeper
291,No . It was the video game Doom which I came across this fact very recently ., Curious to dive deeper
291,"Thanks for that fact ! I remember that game , it was so cool haha . It was nice chatting with you though and just remember , smoking near Associate_in_Nursing apple computer voids the warranty haha .", Curious to dive deeper

292,Who was duke 's first vice Provost for the arts ?, Curious to dive deeper
292,Scott Lindroth I believe . I love how they have these applied arts programs to bring them balance and something different and meaningful to them ., Neutral
292,"I heard that since his time , Duke has grown to have 98 student arts groups .", Surprised
292,"That represent really amazing , love this idea . they have so many more classes directed at the arts now more than ever which is awesome .", Happy
292,I wonder how many programs are devoted to the acoustic piano ?, Curious to dive deeper
292,"I love the piano , but not sure how many programs are devoted to it . by aligning art making with research it makes for a much deep learning experience though .", Happy
292,I am a fan too . Odd that the modern piano has been around since roughly 1700 !, Surprised
292,"Right ! L played years ago , and I also love poetry . Everyone should have a creative side they let out . It is amazing that they found a piano at the top of britains highest mountain .... crazy to think how it got up there lol", Happy
292,"It is funny that they test pianos with Circus Galop , a piece no human could play !", Surprised
292,"Hahaha , that is odd ! I love researching fun facts on the computer and you can find so much ! I use my computer for everything , I write some poetry and save it to my computer ..... you could probably find a program to teach you piano on the computer lol .", Happy
292,"Perhaps so . It is funny that poetry goes back to prehistorical times , but we still can not teach a computer to compose it well !", Surprised
292,"Exactly , there will always be a need for human emotion which nothing tech wise could ever do . The Edgar Allan Poe poem , the Raven was fantastic and he was only paid 9 bucks for it . Wow ....", Happy
292,"Conversely , something as simple as the Japanese Alphabet , when recited in order is besides a poem !", Surprised
292,"I think I read about that while on my computer , and that is amazing actually . I will have to look it up I want to see what it is all about !", Happy
292,"Did you know that in 1936 , Russians made a computer that ran on water !", Surprised
292,"Really ? That is awesome ! something else to research on my computer , I love reading cool facts . Almost all of the Hobbit 's character names were taken out of an old poem , how funny !", Happy
292,Indeed ! I wonder if something similar inspired Demetri Martin 's 224 word palmindrome poem ., Surprised
292,"Exactly ! I need to read that poem , must be very good . I am wanting to find that poem that is record normally is found to be depressing but reading it backwards is inspiring ! Love that !", Curious to dive deeper
292,iodin am looking for some of the poetry from the pyramid texts !, Surprised
292,Oh wow ! Now that would be very interesting ! I may do that myself as well haha ! It has been great chatting with you !, Happy

293,"Hi , how are you ?", Curious to dive deeper
293,Good ! Did you know Kristen Stewart from the Twilight movies helped author a paper about AI ? Not just A pretty face !, Happy
293,"Wow , I had no idea ! That 's pretty cool . Is n't that one lady from Bri bang also like a pHd ?", Curious to dive deeper
293,"I 'm not sure but would n't doubt it . Facebook is developing AI designed to better interpret emotions , identify objects , and predict user actions . Yikes .", Happy
293,Clifford seems to be a great way to augment teaching . I would like to see a pre and post test with a control group to see how well the AI works ., Curious to dive deeper
293,Interesting . atomic_number_85 Stanford they use Google Hangouts to teach AI more effectively ., Happy
293,That 's interesting . I teach college courses and would love to see how that works . I wonder if the non-for-profit has more info on it ., Curious to dive deeper
293,Good question . How about this one -- there 's a NASA scientist WHO believes our world is just a computer generated VR . Maybe he 's been watching too much of The Matrix ., Happy
293,That 's nuts . I sometimes wonder if the ultra-intelligent need things to maintain their sanity ..., Curious to dive deeper
293,"Haha . Definitely . Overthinking can live a torture , I 'm sure . The first Virtual Reality game was created in 1968 . How far we 've come !", Happy
293,I would love to go on Lockheed Martin 's virtual reality tour of mars . seems like it would be a lot of fun ., Happy
293,"It does sound fun . Up to 40 % of VR users get motion sickness -- me included . So make sure to take your barf bulge if you go , just in case .", Happy
293,I never call_back of that impact on people . Have you ever gone on 4D rides at like disney ? They move and shake but then they also spray water on you for when you go through water tunnels or something like that . Pretty fun ., Happy
293,"Yeah , I took my daughter on the Stitch ride and she FREAKED OUT ! She thought it was real . I felt so bad . But that 's proof that 4D can ramp up the experience .", Happy
293,HA ! How old is she ? My 7 year old went on a roller coaster for the first time and freak out until the end and then I could not get him off the rides ., Curious to dive deeper
293,She was 11 . But she has a really active imaginations and she loves Stitch -- so I think a part of her wanted it to be real . Wonder how she would do on that Lockheed Martin VR space bus you mentioned earlier ?, Happy
293,ane am sure she would do great ! Are you on Facebook ?, Curious to dive deeper
293,"Yes , I 'm on FB . Used to be on MySpace too , which offered to buy FB for $ 75 M in 2005 . That would have been the buy of the century .", Happy
293,I know ! Wht Mary_Jane ! Like Iceland rewritting its constituion using ti ., Fearful
293,There 's a German state where it 's illegal to use the `` like '' button on Facebook . Wonder what 's that all about ?, Happy
293,Nice chit-chat with you !, Happy
294,Hello - did you know MySpace turned down an offer to buy Facebook for 75 million in 2005 ?, Surprised
294,"Hi , Are you a registered exploiter of Facebook ?", Curious to dive deeper
294,"Yes I am , what about you ?", Happy
294,Yes . I am thinking of joining the QuitFacebook movement though, Neutral
294,I 'm not a huge fan of Facebook . iodine rarely use it ., Neutral
294,Did you invest in the company astatine the IPO in 2012 ?, Curious to dive deeper
294,I did not . What about you ?, Curious to dive deeper
294,"No , but it would be worth a tidy_sum of money today if you had .", Neutral
294,It would be a big investment . Did you know the Facebook like button is illegal in one of the German state_of_matter ?, Surprised
294,No I did not . WHy is there not a `` dislike '' button, Curious to dive deeper
294,lol not indisputable, Surprised
294,They make most of their money off of ads, Neutral
294,Yea they make a lot bump_off of ads . I saw that Facebook is blue because Mark Zuckerburg is red-green blind ., Surprised
294,"Yeah , that is weird . I know how you can get a free whopper from BK", Neutral
294,How can you get adenine free whopper ?, Surprised
294,If you unfriend 10 people along facebook, Neutral
294,That 's pretty crazy and cool ., Surprised
294,I am thinking about going back to MySPace and deleting Facebook, Neutral
294,I perform n't even know MySpace was still around . I would like to do that as well ., Surprised
294,I want to read the Icelandic Constituion on there first, Neutral
294,I do n't know much just_about that ., Neutral
294,Time to check my posts on Facebook ., Neutral
295,"When I previously thought of virtual reality I thought of gaming , but have you heard about its uses in the educational revolution ?", Surprised
295,"Hello there , same here , no I have n't control too much about the educational side though .", Curious to dive deeper
295,"Through virtual reality , children will be able to attend virtual schools and learn how they want . Through their tablets or visually .", Curious to dive deeper
295,"That is really cool , I guess they can get access to things and places that they never would have been able to before .", Curious to dive deeper
295,"Yes , for example if they want to learn visually they can use the headsets to travel to ancient Egypt and watch the pyramids get built !", Surprised
295,"Wow , that is even cool for me and i 'm an adult !", Curious to dive deeper
295,"It is . It is becoming a lot more affordable too . It used to be over $ 1000 , but inward two or three years should be less than $ 100 .", Happy
295,"I think you are right , I think more schools will have these in the coming years as well .", Curious to dive deeper
295,"Yes , and can even use them at home to educate . The program will allow the parents to keep tabs on their children to see how they are doing .", Happy
295,And I think all of those safety features for parents are a must with whole technology these days !, Curious to dive deeper
295,"Yes , safety and affordability . With a lot of companies like Google , Lenovo , Magic Leap , and Facebook involved you know there will be an affordable and great product .", Curious to dive deeper
295,Yeah and I think there will be profitable business there as well so its win come_through for those companies as well ., Curious to dive deeper
295,"Yes , agreed . You even have a company like Lockheed Martin that can take kids on a virtual reality tour of Mars !", Surprised
295,"Wow , now would n't that be something . I wonder if they will be able to do that with planets further out in the future ?", Curious to dive deeper
295,With all of those companies and a company like Facebook worth over $ 100 billion I am sure they sky the is the limit ., Happy
295,Exactly . Do you use Facebook much ?, Curious to dive deeper
295,ane do . I can not believe in 2005 that Myspace turned down an offer to buy Facebook for $ 75 million !, Surprised
295,"Right ! That would have been one of those deals of a lifetime , but mistakes happen .", Curious to dive deeper
295,"It is impressive how huge it has become . In fact , Iceland follow literally rewriting their constitution using Facebook . They allow the public to chime in with suggestions ! Wild !", Surprised
295,"Yeah I saw that , very interesting . But , it makes sense though , let the people help control how the government operates , not the other way around .", Curious to dive deeper
295,"Yes , basically the opposite of the German state Schleswig-Holstein where the `` comparable '' button is illegal .", Neutral
295,"That is hilarious , I wonder if you went back in time and told people 30 years ago about that , what they would say ? Anyways , it 's been nice talking with you , I hope you have a good daylight .", Happy
296,Hi ! Are you a facebook user ?, Curious to dive deeper
296,"Yes , I coiffe use it , but mostly for the games app 's social part . I 'd rather play a game . I 've heard the Virtual Reality video games are pretty cool . Would you try ?", Curious to dive deeper
296,I think I would try it to get_wind what it was like ., Happy
296,I 've seen lots of exercise on Facebook of people playing a VR game and getting terrified or surprised . It looks like a lot of fun !, Curious to dive deeper
296,I wonder how much the headset cost for it ? The fist virtual reality game was made in 1968 . I had no idea they were around then ., Happy
296,"I thought I 've heard that VR has been used for cultivate soldiers , so I wonder if it could have been around for even longer than 1968 , but kept secret !", Curious to dive deeper
296,Quite possible . I read where 40 percent of users experience motion sickness in virtual reality ., Happy
296,"Well , that part does n't sound very fun . Did you know there is a NASA scientist who genuinely believes we 're living in a reality generated by a computer ? Or peradventure multiple computers ...", Curious to dive deeper
296,I did n't know that . I know that Lockheed Martin has a virtual reality `` Mars bus '' that can take kids on a tour of Mars . That would be neat ., Happy
296,"Wow , I was excited when i heard a company was starting art buses to park in lots of shopping centers to look after kids while parents shop . I ca n't even imagine how great a VR Mars tour bus would be ! ! !", Curious to dive deeper
296,Hahaha Do you know anyone that has the Oculus Rift VR headset that Facebook released ?, Curious to dive deeper
296,"I do n't , but I 'd love to try it . I am really interested in those augmented reality systems that area a type of VR . I had an idea for those Google glasses before they came out , even !", Curious to dive deeper
296,Nice ! Stanford 's free artificial intelligence class uses Google plus hangouts to help them teach more effectively . What do you think of AI ? information_technology kind of scares me . lol, Happy
296,Meant to say augmented reality . I think it 's strange how Tesler 's Theorem for AI is whatever has n't been done yet . Does that mean he would n't call the VR games AI ?, Curious to dive deeper
296,I have no_more idea . Good question . AI has crushed all human records in the puzzle game `` 2048 '' . I have n't heard of that game ., Happy
296,"I have n't heard of that game , either . There 's a game I play where you get better by doing daily tasks . I should make an AI device to do it for me !", Happy
296,lol Nice ! Did you hear about the promotion that Burger King ran where if you were to unfriend 10 people on Facebook they would give you a free whopper ? I would have lead them up on that ., Curious to dive deeper
296,"I think there were probably people catching on and adding 10 random people just to unfriend , though ! Can you believe that in a part of Germany the Facebook like button is illegal ?", Curious to dive deeper
296,I wonder why ? I 'm going to have to look that up . I wonder what Myspace thinks of passing up on the chance to buy Facebook for $ 75 million in 2005 ? Is Myspace even still approximately ?, Happy
296,I cerebrate MySpace is around but everyone uses Facebook instead . I think Facebook is worth hundreds of billions today ., Curious to dive deeper
296,In 2012 when they had their IPO they were valued at $ 104 billion then . So you are right . I 'm sure it 's more than that now . It 's been fun chatting with you !, Happy
297,How 's it going ? Do you know much about VR ? Looks like it is not meeting it 's potential as an educational tool, Curious to dive deeper
297,"Hello there , I know just a little bit , I heard that is true though , that they do n't really have the ability to tailor-make the material to the individual or coach .", Curious to dive deeper
297,That seems uneven and something that would be easy to fix if the effort was put in . Learning history and geography seems like a perfect fit for VR, Surprised
297,"Yeah I think you are right , especially for those children that comprise strong visual learners .", Curious to dive deeper
297,VR does sound like a great tool for those who struggle with time restrict, Neutral
297,Yeah I think it has the potential to be . Do you love much about AI ?, Curious to dive deeper
297,"non much except for what 's in pop culture , I definitely could n't explain Tesler 's Theorem that well", Neutral
297,"I think I 'm about the same , I know IBM 's Watson is very helpful IN the medical field .", Curious to dive deeper
297,Yea I 've heard of Watson and a little about Stanford 's ai class which I might have to take a look at when I got the time, Curious to dive deeper
297,Did you know the actress Kristen Stewart co-authored a paper on three-toed_sloth ?, Curious to dive deeper
297,"No , I let no clue . I do n't know if I 'm more surprised of that or the first vr game being made in 1968", Surprised
297,"Holy cow , I never would have guessed that about VR . Did you know doctors are using it to treat phobias ?", Curious to dive deeper
297,"Yea , I 've heard of that , very cool . Lockheed Martin uses VR to tour Mars which is pretty cool also", Neutral
297,"Wow , that would be pretty cool to try , I wonder what you have to do to be a part of that ?", Curious to dive deeper
297,"I do n't know , maybe be in a smart class or just be in a school that personify nearby a Lockheed Martin facility", Neutral
297,"Yeah you cost probably right . On a different note , are you a user of Facebook ?", Curious to dive deeper
297,"Yea , I think I started using it in 2006 , two years afterward it was first founded by Zuckerberg and his Harvard classmates", Neutral
297,"Yeah I think I am the same , I 'm somewhat sure my roommate in college set one up for me in 2005 .", Curious to dive deeper
297,"I use to like myspace a lot better in high school , Tom must be kicking himself for non buying facebook in 2005", Neutral
297,Yeah think about how much money was lost not buying it way back then . I think I set up a Myspace account but never exploited it ., Curious to dive deeper
297,Well FB is evaluate at 104 billion right now but it would probably be worth a lot less if myspace did buy it, Neutral
297,"Yeah that is true , but I 'm willing to bet it would be worth more than Myspace currently is . Well it was nice talking with you today , I hope you enjoy the rest of the day .", Happy
298,how-do-you-do, Neutral
298,Hello how are you doing ? Myspace turned down an offer to buy facebook for $ 75 million in early 2005, Curious to dive deeper

298,Right ! Missed opportunity ! Facebook 's `` like '' button is illegal in the german state of schleswig-holstein ., Curious to dive deeper
298,ace wonder exactly what is so bad about it . The King of Pop started his solo career in 1971 ., Curious to dive deeper
298,Yeah i know right . Why are they so against the thumbs up . Freddie mercury cancelled a duet with michael jackson in the 1980s, Curious to dive deeper
298,"Freddy 's vocals would 've destroyed jacksons . also - a llama , really dude ?", Neutral
298,hahaha well MJ is really weird . Maybe it gives him intake ! Michael jackson wanted to build a 50 foot robot of himself to roam the nevada desert ., Curious to dive deeper
298,only thing i have in common with the sheik is being a massive simpsons fan . if i ran into that robot i would think i was tripping, Neutral

298,"you know , im not sure ..... yeah ! Saami here . havent really watched it much lately . taylor switf removed her music from spotify but kept it on pandora . think it was the money ?", Curious to dive deeper
298,Maybe . This is a ton of money Aloe blacc only received $ 12k in royalties from pandora for 168 million streams, Curious to dive deeper
298,seems like someone got robbed . pandora makes 274 million in revenue, Neutral
298,"This is awesome , I love listening to stand up Pandora now streams stand up comedy in addition to music .", Curious to dive deeper
298,woah - i had atomic_number_102 idea . pandora is powered by the music genome project . ever heard of it ? i havent, Curious to dive deeper
298,nobelium I havent ., Curious to dive deeper
298,an effort to capture the essesne of music at the most fundamental level . i wonder what else they do ., Curious to dive deeper

298,right ! ! nice talking to you . have a good one ., Curious to dive deeper
299,Are you along Facebook by any chance ?, Curious to dive deeper
299,"yes , I found it interesting that mark zukerburg suffers from colorblindness", Neutral
299,I was not aware of that . Facebook debuted in 2004 . I was not aware it had been so long . It makes me wonder how long I was on MySpace before that ., Surprised
299,"I agree , I wonder why Warren_E._Burger king wanted people to unfriend others", Happy
299,I was not aware that they did . That 's very strange . You 'd think they 'd rather advertise on the site since so many people are on there . Facebook prepare most of it 's revenue from advertisements ., Surprised
299,I understand that to be true as_well . I cant believe Iceland is using Facebook to rewrite their Constitution, Happy
299,That seems like a bad idea . People do n't think before they type on Facebook and they 're willing to be more ridiculous because they are behind a keyboard ., Fearful
299,"Agreed . I have alsways really liked Micheal Jackson , and I knew he did work on the Simpsons", Happy
299,"I have mixed feelings about him . As a pop star he was amazing , his personal life not so much . My discernment is that Freddie Mercury cancelled a duet with him because he insisted on bringing his llama to the studio .", Curious to dive deeper
299,"Yes I understand the feelings , would have loved to project the 50 foot robot though", Surprised
299,He had some very out there ideas . I did know that Eddie Van Halen Played the guitar solo in Beat It free of charge ., Curious to dive deeper
299,I did not know that either . and that Micheal helped write the soundtrack to sonic 3, Happy

306,Yeah highway tolls be more than $ 300 dollars thats too much money, Curious to dive deeper
306,"I guess if you traveled there , it would be best to focus on one city so you do n't have to spend on traveling around . It 's probably expensive to travel in Iceland too . Most people there without cars take flights to get from city to city !", Surprised
306,"That makes sense , seems like it would be just as expensive and the flight time is less , the firs king of Hawai sure traveled a lot", Curious to dive deeper

307,Interesting . What do you cognize about machine learning ?, Curious to dive deeper
307,"It is learning done past machines . Beyond that , not much . You ?", Neutral
307,They have an algo that can mine rap lyrics and drop_a_line their own ., Curious to dive deeper
307,That is very poise . Soon we will not need rap artists . We can have the machines do it for us ., Neutral
307,"Hilarious . Yeah , it will be like that Beastie Boys song Intergalatic .", Curious to dive deeper
307,"Yes , that would be great . What else do you know that is interesting about machine learning ?", Neutral
307,Apparently there are `` are you human `` tests that aid in the design of machine get_a_line ., Curious to dive deeper

308,"$ 350 really is too expensive . I get that Apple tries to go for the high-end market , but good grief .", Disgusted
308,siri was intended for android and blackberry initially and it 's funny now because the amazon chief_operating_officer talks about how limited it 's abilities are now ., Surprised
308,"Siri is n't even compatible with Spotify on the Homepod . When your assistant ca n't talk to your music to play on your speakers , there 's a problem !", Surprised
308,i have a huge problem getting alexa to connect too sometimes tho . it always tries to open `` spotty control '' ... my husband and I always joke that we are an `` amazon family '' i did n't realize how true that was until I learned that amazon cause owned IMDB since 98 !, Happy
308,Since '98 ? No kidding ! I guess it makes sense for a company that started as a bookstore to branch out into movies next ., Surprised
308,"yeah , i remember when they only sold books . a distant memory I think . now the workers walk 7-15 miles each shift .", Curious to dive deeper
308,That makes me wonder how many miles the goats Google used to trim their grass traveled . Maybe 15 miles ?, Curious to dive deeper
308,hahaha Google has some wild things . I used to live in the bay and their workspace is very unique ., Surprised
308,You 've seen the Googleplex ? Neat ! What 's it like ?, Surprised

308,"that comprise a throwback . Cortana is n't very useful , but I like bing as a search engine ... and i like that they pay you points that can be changed in for giftcards .", Happy
308,Cortana was helpful in annulus at least . Ca n't really picture Siri hanging out with Master Chief ., Happy
308,my friend met the siri lady in an airport once . that was interesting ., Neutral
308,Hah ! I wonder how the male voice actors feel . Mr. Briggs did n't even know he WAS the vocalization until he heard himself in a commercial ., Surprised
308,yeah talk about being the weakest link . I wonder how that happens though ... like do n't they have to pay for his voice ?, Surprised
308,"Maybe it was some kind of contract work , and the client was n't disclosed .", Curious to dive deeper
308,"maybe that is a good point . thanks for chatting , unity had a great time talking . : )", Happy
308,Me too ! Best of luck to you and your `` Amazon Family ! '' Take care ., Happy

310,"Oh , yeah , usually Siri is turned off for me like on my other Apple devices , but I have found that it sometimes comes in handy for phones when driving although most of the times it 's quite_an frustrating because they do n't understand me and do something else . Considering Siri 's best skill is being a musicologist , I will have to try out that feature some time .", Surprised
310,"It scares me , I was unaware that Apple had something called the Homepod .", Curious to dive deeper
310,"Apple has restricted the scope of the HomePod 's intelligence , considering that Siri gets things wrong about 10 % of the time . It 's nice that they built the technology so that everyone is treated the same , which raises privacy concerns because anyone give_notice ask to read owner 's messages .", Surprised

310,"From what I read , Delta Airlines , subway terminus , voice of Siri , etc . I 'm guessing any commercial voice you hear in public places might be hers .", Surprised
310,"OMG , that is awesome . I bet Amazon workers are tired after walking 7-15 miles each day .", Curious to dive deeper
310,"They are definitely tired , but on the bright side , they believably do n't need gym memberships because they might be in great shape !", Surprised
310,That 's true . The low customer spent $ 27.95, Curious to dive deeper
311,Did you listen about the 300 crocodiles killed in Indonesia ?, Neutral
311,Yeah I think that is sad . Us humans are invading these animals ' space and we think we own the place ., Sad
311,"I agree . We dont even respect other humans , so animals definitely dont get any resepct . We really need to treat every living thing with respect .", Sad
311,It 's especially bad because it was a licensed sanctuary that Sugito wandered into to collect food . This was undoubtedly done without permission ., Sad
311,It is like when the kid fell into Harambe 's cage ., Neutral
311,"Right , I was mad about that one too . Police tried to stop the killings but there were 600 people so it was unimaginable .", Surprised
311,That is horrible . There are 20 quintillion ( yeah that cost a number ) animals on earth and humans are one . Id say we are slightly outnumbered ., Neutral
311,Killing a protected species is a crime inch Indonesia so it was just those people who were out of control . What 's gross is the villagers took selfies with the crocodiles afterward ., Sad
311,"I would get killing the one , but trying to exterminate a species because of one bad one is stupid .", Curious to dive deeper
311,"Yeah , and I still do n't think it 's bad because the villager wandered into its habitat . But some people did question the logic of having crocodile ponds so close to a village .", Sad
311,Or rather building a village close to where the animals already live ., Neutral
311,What just_about the Disney World alligator ? Did you hear about that one ?, Surprised
311,"I vaguely remember something about that , what was the deal with it again ?", Curious to dive deeper
311,There was a sign that said stay off from the water but the parents let him get too close to the pond . He was scooping up water into a pail when he was snatched . Poor kid ., Sad
311,"I remember that now . I feel bad , it is just awareness . Some people have none", Neutral
311,"Yeah , I heard that he was also playing in the water . And in this case they euthanized the alligator and humanely removed others .", Sad
311,"Removal I can deal with , only if we were not intruding along their initial home .", Neutral
311,Yeah well I guess Disney World built where there were already alligators naturally . Seems pretty ineivitable in many areas of Florida that we would intrude . Sigh . I feel bad for the boy but the crocodile was probably just acting in its nature because it 's a carnivore ., Sad
311,"Thinking like this little snack wandered into my domicile , how nice .", Curious to dive deeper
311,"Right . : / And as humans we make handbags of alligators all the time . That being said , I 'd be very protective of my children if an animal came to attack them .", Sad
311,True . Its been great chatting ! Have a nice day !, Neutral
312,cost you a fan of Disney movies ?, Curious to dive deeper
312,"Hi , how are you ? Yes , I do like Disney films . Loved them as a kid . I have n't seen one in a while though . What was the last Disney film that you saw ?", Neutral
312,"I saw Moana last , but also Frozen shortly before that , it was the first film directed by a woman by Disney , you ?", Curious to dive deeper
312,"I think I saw an animated film , probably Fantasia ? A long time ago . I have heard good affair about Frozen .", Neutral
312,"That was a while ago , an instant disney classic . Did you know toy companies get involved before they even make movies", Curious to dive deeper
312,The marketing and the licensing are all together on this . The film seems to be a giant commercial for toys ! LOL, Neutral
312,"For sure , that is a good way to order it ! Do you have a favorite animal ?", Curious to dive deeper
312,I guess dogs are my favorite . There are so many out there ! Elephants are cool too ., Neutral
312,me too I love dogs so a_great_deal . Elephants and dogs are the only animals that respond to pointing, Curious to dive deeper
312,That makes sentience . Elephants have a tremendous intellect . I think they are much smarter than we suspect ., Neutral
312,Did you know there are like xx quintillion individual animals on this planet, Curious to dive deeper
312,I figure we 're killing them at a rate that is going to hurt our chances of survival . That is something we should worry about ., Neutral
312,"For sure , it is sad to think that is happening . Hiccups formed i mean because of animals", Curious to dive deeper
312,"We probably do not need hiccups directly , but there are there from a long time ago . Maybe when we breathed differently .", Neutral
312,"That is very true . in 2002 animals were given actual rights in Germany , should happen everywhere", Curious to dive deeper
312,Animals should have someone to advocate for them . Too often animals are left to fend for themselves . I marvel who the lawyers are ., Neutral
312,"For sure , humans could do this if they were n't so meddling doing other things .", Curious to dive deeper
312,"I wish that we had a longer term vision of our place on the planet . We do n't . Humans are separate from animals , but not independent . We will be their fate if we destroy the planet .", Neutral
312,"For sure , I will be long gone by then but sad to think it will probably happen . good chew_the_fat with you !", Curious to dive deeper
312,Nice chitchat with you too !, Neutral
312,Have a peachy weekend ! BYE, Curious to dive deeper
313,People in Indoenesia do not like crocodiles . They killed 300 after i killed a villager ., Surprised
313,"I can see how the crocodiles can be dangerous though . For them , it 's about human safety", Neutral
313,"I understand , but the guy that was stamp_out was in a protected croc sanctuary . It was kind of his fault .", Curious to dive deeper
313,"And I guess the species is endangered , which is part of why it 's a crowing deal", Neutral
313,"Yes . 40 cops well-tried to stop the crowd , but it turned into a mob of 600 villagers .", Fearful
313,"Most of the time they try to remove the animals humanely , but those cases are also in the United States . Those villagers in_all_likelihood acted out of fear", Neutral
313,"Yes , in some instances animals that attack are required to be put down and tested for disease like madness", Curious to dive deeper
313,"On the other end of the spectrum , animals have guaranteed legal right_field in Germany", Neutral
313,That live good . There is a line between public safety and animal cruelty, Disgusted
313,"As long as the public is safe . In Scotland , the Loch Ness monster is a protected species", Neutral
313,That is funny . Next it will cost bigfoot, Happy
313,"If Bigfoot is in the US , that one may not happen . Although if he has a white patch on his forehead , it 's a sign that he 's domesticated", Neutral
313,Apparently humanity looked like bigfoot many years ago . Then about 240 thousand years ago we lost body hair, Curious to dive deeper
313,One thing we did n't lose are hiccups . It 's a leftover result of when country animals had both lungs and gills, Neutral
313,That is insane to think how species evolved . Now that are 20 quintillion different animals on earth, Curious to dive deeper
313,"And yet among all those , we are the best distance runners due to persistence during hunting", Neutral
313,"Yes , but we hold to buy our vitamin C. Most other animals and plants produce it naturally", Curious to dive deeper
313,"True , but I wonder how many other animals can regrow a rib in 2-3 calendar_month after it 's surgically shortened", Neutral
313,That is true . And we can use tools . Let 's see a crocodile do that, Curious to dive deeper
313,I wonder if there 's a sound frequency that can cause fear in them like there 's one that does Hoosier_State humans, Curious to dive deeper
313,Maybe that is why we build fires and make weapons . To guard against the fear, Neutral
314,Aloha_State do you like animals ?, Curious to dive deeper
314,Hi . I love animals . I have a couple of favourite . How about you ?, Happy
314,"I also love animals , I have a dog , but Ive been asking my husband for a dragon for years", Surprised
314,"I do n't think he 'll be able to find that . Out of the 20 quintillion animal types on the planet , I do n't think dragon 's subsist .", Neutral
314,"well not the ones one want . But they do exist , the kimodo dragon .", Curious to dive deeper
314,Oh that 's right . I forgot those little guys are still around . set you know Germany is the first country in the world to give animals legal rights ?, Curious to dive deeper
314,"Yeah I think the kimodo dragon actually has its own island too lol I didnt know that , what rights are those ?", Curious to dive deeper
314,"Yes , I think the do have an island . As for the legal rights , I 'm not entirely sure but pretty much what humans have .", Neutral
314,I see . Did you know dogs have 12 pedigree types ?, Curious to dive deeper
314,"No , I had no idea . That is interesting . Did you know animals develop white patches on their foreheads when they are domesticated ?", Curious to dive deeper
314,Is that every animal ? I never seen it on any of my dogs or fish . That is interesting ., Curious to dive deeper
314,"Yes , my beast have those patches . I think it 's all the head pats .", Neutral
314,lol what kind of animals do you have ?, Curious to dive deeper
314,"I have two cats . They are rescues , really good cats but they seems to hate the movie Frozen . Did you know that was the first Disney film directed by a woman ?", Neutral
314,"Nice , my dog is a rescue . I wonder why they hate frozen , it has such good songs . No I didnt know that .", Curious to dive deeper
314,I do n't know but they literally growl at the TV when its on . I guess they are n't Disney fans . I wonder if they would like the lion king ., Curious to dive deeper
314,"Yeah show them something they might relate to , cats . did you know that wreck it ralph developement started in the 1980s , took so long to get that movie finish , turned out great though .", Curious to dive deeper
314,"I take no idea , that is a long time of development . I was also surprised to find out the lion king was the first Disney film to be dubbed in Zulu for its African release .", Curious to dive deeper
314,"Thats good , they should make it dubbed in more languages .", Curious to dive deeper
314,"Yeah , they are trying to sell to a big audience . I mean diddle industries are involved with Disney animations before they begin making the films .", Neutral
314,"That seems like a given , these toys come out way before the movie to promote it and get kids excited about the movie .", Curious to dive deeper
314,"Well its no surprise . Disney is one of Hollywood 's biggest pic studios . If they make something , then you should get in while you can .", Neutral
314,"Yeah , IT been good talking to you .", Curious to dive deeper
315,Is Google your # 1 search engine ?, Curious to dive deeper
315,"Yeah , pretty much . I 'm locked into deoxyadenosine_monophosphate disturbing amount of their utilities . How about you ?", Disgusted
315,"I love Google , iodin ca n't stand other search engines like bing or yahoo", Curious to dive deeper
315,1 refuse to use Bing because I despise Microsoft even more than Google ., Disgusted
315,"lol , Google is incredible though , it requires more computing power for one search than it took to send neil armstrong to the moon !", Curious to dive deeper
315,"Yeah , pretty much any kind of personal electronic device these days would put the supercomputers of that period to shame .", Neutral
315,"that is very true , a lot has come since back then . How about siri , are you a fan ?", Curious to dive deeper
315,"I do n't even have a smart phone , so I 've never used it . have you ?", Neutral
315,"wow , you are daring , i like it ! I have an iphone but never use siri , I would rather just google something instead to be honest .", Curious to dive deeper
315,"I 'm not really daring , LOL . I just live in a 3G dead zone and I 'm self-employed , so I just need a basic tracfone in case I have an emergency on my occasional trips to town . But my laptop is all the Internet connection I need .", Happy
315,"I have a friend like that also , no shame in that . That is perfect though with your laptop because you can still transmit with others if needed . Do you do a lot of amazon shopping ?", Curious to dive deeper
315,"A fair amount , although they 're another corporation I detest : ) I get better deals on supplements and used books . How about you ?", Neutral
315,"For sure , IT was started as a book company in 1994", Surprised
315,"They 're a good source of out-of-print stuff , for sure . Library Genesis is also good for obtaining `` unauthorized '' pdfs of a whole lot of books . I always check there before Amazon .", Happy
315,"I will have to check that out , is that legal to use ? I am taking my masters and books cost too much", Curious to dive deeper
315,"The uploads are probably copyright violations , but I 've never heard of anybody having trouble over downloading from it . And any academic book you want there 's a better than 90 % chance you 'll find it there . Just Google `` Library Genesis '' to come_up mirror sites .", Happy
315,"wow , I will do that , thank you ! plunk_for to amazon though , jeff bezos has a clock in a mountain that will run for 10,000 , i wonder why", Curious to dive deeper
315,"It sounds a lot like something called the Long straightaway Project that did something similar , IIRC .", Curious to dive deeper
315,"I will have to look into that , that sounds interesting . I just googled library genesis . It was thence nice chatting with you !", Curious to dive deeper
315,Likewise . But I do n't think we 're quite done yet ., Neutral
315,"Now we are , enjoy your weekend !", Curious to dive deeper
315,You besides !, Happy
316,It looks like Apple is have some problems with its new HomePod product . Do you have one ?, Curious to dive deeper
316,No I do n't bear one . But my parents do have an Amazon Alexa and my brother has a Google home which are similar devices . do you have one by the way ?, Curious to dive deeper
316,Apple always overprices their stuff allowing others to offer merchandise that are just as good at a lower price . Kids and young adults buy them because they are `` cute '' and popular in their little clicks ., Surprised
316,"Yep I think so . It 's crazy that there have represent over four hundred million smart home devices shipped back in 2017 and it is projected to reach almost 1 billion devices by the year 2022 though , so they are definitely going to get more popular over time", Surprised
316,I still feel stupid talking to an inanimate object . Siri was n't even and Malus_pumila development . It was originally intended for Android but Apple bought it ., Curious to dive deeper
316,"Haha that 's really weird . I also think it 's weird that Apple went for the high-end Market with their homepod , when you can get a Google home for about $ 100 a homepod goes for almost four hundred , that 's definitely a rip off", Surprised
316,"Yeah , that 's Apple . They have become more competitive but , face it , comparable everyone else their stuff is made somewhere in Asia . SO do you use something like Siri or Cortana ?", Curious to dive deeper
316,"No I just stick to Google myself , I do n't know what google 's voice assistant is called but it 's not Siri or Cortana , what about you ? What do you use", Curious to dive deeper
316,On my phone it 's Google like you . On my laptop it 's Cortana by I do n't use it much . I did n't know there was a Male Siri -- a British guy ?, Curious to dive deeper
316,No I did n't know that either . I only heard the female Siri haha . What do you think about the fact that a Google search uses more computing power than the power it took to send an astronaut to the Moon, Surprised
316,People binding then were good with a slide rule ! I think smart people will always be needed and computers will not take over the world ., Surprised
316,Yes I think so . What it is crazy how far technology has come . For instance Google can employ Android devices on the roads to map traffic data, Surprised
316,Yeah . I do n't remember Google going down for 5 minutes in 2013 . It took 40 % of web traffic with it . I probably thought it was a problem on my end ., Surprised
316,"Wow that 's a crazy amount of traffic ! And no I do n't remember that either , what do you think about the fact that Google Maps changes its Maps based on where you are searching from ? That way if there is a dispute on a countries border it will create the border based on the user 's location data ?", Curious to dive deeper
316,That is interesting ... They sure go to a lot of trouble . Like when they used goats as lawn mowers . They clearly did n't know how ornery goats are ., Curious to dive deeper
316,"Haha that sounds like that would have taken a long time , what do you think about the fact that the CEO of Amazon actually built a clock into a mountain ? I do n't know why he would do that do you", Curious to dive deeper
316,"Yeah , Bezos will do that in lieu of compensating his employees . He 's another one of the lefty liberals that would disappear if you removed the hypocrisy from them .", Disgusted
316,"LOL I like the way you think . it is crazy though that Amazon owns imdb.com , unity use that almost everyday for my movie collection", Surprised
316,I love IMDB and was surprised to learn that . I also learned that the 1st Amazon customer got a building named after him ., Surprised
316,"Yeah that is shocking . And since I do n't have an iPhone I would n't know this , but apparently if you ask Siri to sing a song then she will sing the song that HAL 9000 sings in 2001 A Space Odyssey which is definitely creepy haha", Surprised
316,That would be a little creepy . Kubrick did the Hal 9000 thing where it was kind of chilling ... Thanks for the excellent chat !, Surprised
317,hi how are you ? Doctor_of_Osteopathy you use amazon ?, Neutral
317,"Hello I am doing great ! I do , a little more than I want to though , how about you ?", Curious to dive deeper
317,"I sometimes use it , when i dont have time to shop . i like to check things out in the store , if possible .", Neutral
317,information_technology 's sad but I have turned into the complete opposite ! I only go to the store if it 's not on amazon haha . I wish I was the first customer to buy something though !, Curious to dive deeper
317,I would rather have amazon prime for life than a building bring_up after me ., Neutral
317,Haha I would like that as well haha . Can you believe how many miles a day Associate_in_Nursing Amazon worker walks a day ?, Curious to dive deeper
317,"I think that they must lose a raft of weight , or get really bad knees LOL", Neutral
317,I bet ! I cause n't even know IMDB was owned by Amazon too . They have the hand in every cookie jar haha ., Curious to dive deeper
317,"Yeah , soon amazon will own everything and we will all work at amazon . 15 miles a day . can i do that at my age ? LOL", Neutral
317,I 'm only 30 and am dreading that just thinking about it lol . Maybe Google will try and stop them ?, Surprised
317,Google and amazon will unify . all searches will produce amazon results . you will use your wages from google or amazon to buy goods online from amazon ., Neutral
317,It 's like the movie terminator ! SKYNET live OUT TO GET US ! ! ! ! haha it really is crazy how much stake Google has in the internet ., Surprised
317,"google dominates , but there is perpetually some upstart that unseats the dominant firm . i wonder who that will be .", Neutral
317,"Well Google falls under Alphabet now , so I feel like they are receive prepared for that !", Curious to dive deeper
317,"Yes , from A to Z , they will control everything . oh , well . i for one hail our new corporate overlords .", Neutral
317,Apple even has a big piece of everything . Do you experience an iPhone and use Siri ?, Surprised
317,I dont have an iphone . too expensive . i really dont want an electronic reconciler in my pocket LOL, Neutral
317,haha I have the iPhone SE which came out like 5 years ago haha . I hardly ever use Siri but people love her !, Surprised
317,Siri is probably convenient but isnt it always listening to you ? i dont want that kind of eavesdropping ., Neutral
317,I 'm sure it is . Apple must have a lot of boring data on me haha ., Curious to dive deeper
317,"Yeah , me too , and i dont even use Apple . LOL anyway , great chat !", Neutral
317,Thanks you as well . Have a good Night !, Curious to dive deeper
318,hi how represent you ? do you like to dance ?, Neutral

318,i cant say that im surprised . he must have had a great sense of rhythm . i bet He was a real ladies ' man ., Neutral
318,"Yeah , I bet . Did you know ballet dancers can go through four pairs of pointe shoes in angstrom week .", Happy
318,"if i were a professional_dancer , i would go through a dozen . LOL . i can not dance . really .", Neutral
318,Me too ! do you know Michael Jackson has a patent ?, Happy
318,is that the patent on the shoes for that special tend ? he really was a genius ., Neutral
318,It was a device used to achieve the extreme lean Hoosier_State some of his dance moves ., Happy
318,"yeah , thats IT ! i was never any good at dancing . i wonder if you have to start when youre young .", Neutral
318,"Well , I know babies spontaneously dance when they hear euphony . Maybe the better dancers heard a lot of music when they were younger .", Happy
318,i wonder if i heard enough music . perchance that was it . maybe i missed by window . oh well ., Neutral
318,"Yeah , maybe . I know they grin more when they hit the bet .", Happy
318,I use smile when i smash a bet too . LOL i heard that tupac was a dancer back in high school ., Neutral
318,"Yeah , I think he danced in the Nutcracker in HS .", Happy
318,"I bet he was really good too . he was a reliever dancer for digital underground later on . by the way , are you a fan of snakes ?", Neutral
318,No . I 'm not crazy about snakes . There 's no snakes in New Sjaelland ., Happy
318,so ive heard . i guess i would move there if i had a phobia of snakes . i have never seen a flying snake . that would be frightening ., Neutral
318,"No , basically they ; re legless lizards without limbs .", Happy
318,"oh , ok . The fear of snakes is hard-wired in human brains . i guess that makes sense . we needed it for evolution .", Neutral
318,"Yeah , can you believe that crocodiles are more closely related to birds than to snakes .", Happy
318,"i guess scales and feathers are analogous ? i never know they were related . Anyway , great chat !", Neutral
318,"Yeah , good babble with you too !", Surprised
319,"Hi ! Are you familiar with Bad Times at the El Royale ? I feel it basically defies expectations even though not all of its surprises are pleasant but there is satisfaction , however !", Neutral
319,"hi how are you ? I have heard of it . it is a movie that make_out out recently , right ?", Neutral
319,"Not too long ago and it 's basically set in 1969 and is also kind of a B movie , black comedy and mystery ! Drew Goddard directed it as well !", Neutral
319,deoxyadenosine_monophosphate B movie ? Great ! that sounds fun . low budget ? doesnt take itself too seriously ?, Neutral
319,"Exactly . So are you a horror fan in general ? I watch repugnance films as a workout because you can burn over 180 calories just by watching them , surprisingly enough !", Neutral
319,"ace thnk the first time it would burn that many , but the second time maybe not . not so scary .", Neutral
319,"That is a good point . But you know what else is crazy , they say if you view abstract art after watching a horror film , you 'll enjoy it a lot more ! I need to try that !", Surprised
319,How does that even work ? is your brain more active ? more emotionally sensitive ?, Neutral
319,"I would guess so . It 's so weird , is n't it ? I tell you what else is weird , Stephen King once said Bambi was the first horror movie he watched . Can you believe that ? He definitely has a twisted mind , does n't he ?", Surprised
319,He probably was traumatized by that disney flick and ended upward fascinated with the macabre ., Neutral
319,Agreed ! You know what else gets me ? Danny from The Shining did n't actually know he was acting Indiana a horror movie until years later . It 's like how did he not know ?, Surprised
319,I guess he was .... slow ? i dont know . what kind of movie suffice he imagine it to be ?, Neutral
319,"That 's what I 'm wondering . Ha ! But enough of this horror talk , or else I 'm going to get scared . Ha ! Are you a fantasy fan at all ? I 'd like to join the national spelling bee fantasy draft one of these days !", Neutral
319,I have never down fantasy sports . I guess the appeal is that you vie and can make some money ?, Neutral
319,I guess so ! But I also think it 's cool that a single fold in our brains basically separate how we perceive reality and fantasy . That 's truly amazing !, Neutral
319,I wonder if my flock has come unfolded in recent years . i feel that my time on the internet has blurred the line ., Neutral
319,"Ha ! I hump what you mean . It is hard to distinguish at times , is n't it ? Maybe we should start writing fantasy . Then hopefully we can be knighted for our services to literature like author Terry Pratchett was !", Neutral
319,Terry is a great writer . He deserves the recognition . do we have to birdcall him sir terry though ?, Neutral
319,"I suppose he 's earned that title . Ha ! On a similar fantasy note ( if you would consider this movie fantasy like I kind of do ) , do you like Thor ? I think it 's crazy Ant Man of all characters made his Marvel debut in_front Thor and even Hulk , Iron Man and Spider Man ! Is n't that unbelievable ?", Surprised

320,"They must be fresh , lol . What about the legless lizards . They look like snakes", Surprised
320,"I do n't like those either , nor eels . I do think it 's fascinating that they have their paired electric_organ one in front of another , opposed to side-by-side .", Curious to dive deeper
320,"That is fascinating . I also think that the fact that In Britain , politicians had tomwear a top hat if making a point of order in the house of commons until 1998 .", Surprised
320,"That 's insane . Kinda like people thinking that in the old west , the bowler was most popular , non the cowboy hat .", Surprised
320,"Oh really , neat . When someone tips their hat to you , it originated from knights lifting their face visors to show friendliness .", Curious to dive deeper
320,"I did know that ! It was explained to us at Medieval Times . Yet , the distance of ladies hatpins were regulated , so they could not be used as a weapon .", Curious to dive deeper
320,That sounds reasonable . Some hats regular have religious fuct, Neutral

325,"I guess so ! I was surprised when I learned that . Imagine the Marlboro cowboy in a bowler ! That would n't work though , because a cowboy really does need a cowboy hat to protect against the sun and rain .", Curious to dive deeper

325,"Well humans and monkeys are distantly related lol . thither are legless lizards also . I do n't mind legged lizards , but I do n't think I would look at a legless lizard as anything less than a snake .", Surprised
325,"If it does n't have legs , I am checking out . A legless lizard is a snake ! You know , I was reading that crocodiles are closer related to birds then ophidian and lizards . I would have never guessed that .", Curious to dive deeper
325,"Haha checking out . Agreed . I would n't have guessed that about crocodiles either . I always call alligators/crocodiles dinosaurs , and I heard that chickens are likely descendants of dinosaur .. so maybe I am onto something ?", Curious to dive deeper
325,"If you have seen Jurassic park and consider it ( I kinda do ) then you would agree . Hey , do you like dancing ? Did you know that it can be categorized and described by its choreography . I am horrible , but its fun .", Surprised

332,What about birds . do you like them ? I think hummingbirds are amazing . They steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nest, Curious to dive deeper
332,"haha that is funny , I do like birds , I think it would be scary to be in Austrailia and birds there can mimic different sounds , like you 're walking along and think someone is chasing you with a chainsaw , but it 's just a bird making that sound haha", Happy
332,wow that would be scary ! I saw that the famously discint do do bird is actually a sub-family of pigeon, Curious to dive deeper
332,"that is wild , I know people hunted the fogy because they were eating them , so I guess if we want to know what they tasted like we could try pigeon haha", Curious to dive deeper
332,this is interesting . In most birds the bones are so hollow that their entire skeleton weighs LE than their feathers, Curious to dive deeper
332,"that is wild , I think it 's crazy that there are razzing that fly the distance of Alaska to Mexico without sleeping , thats a lot of endurance !", Curious to dive deeper
332,I saw that human activity threatens about 1200 boo species with extinction, Curious to dive deeper
332,"ya that is sad , we are using up earth 's resources , and I know that by the end of the 21st century we will have run out of helium which is real important for manufacturing", Curious to dive deeper
332,Wow that is crazy . more than 80 percent of the earths natural forest have already been destroyed, Curious to dive deeper
332,"ya that is sad , what 's really crazy is how quickly this is happening , so far mankind would only represent about a minute if you consider the entire history of earth to be 24 hours long", Curious to dive deeper
332,Ok so this is totally of subject but the joined nations appointedd official ambassadors to extraterrestrials, Surprised
332,"haha I wonder how they appointed that guy , like he essentially knows that he will never have_got to work , like what does that guy do all day ? I want his job haha", Happy
332,Exactly that is so funny ! Did you that over 7.6 billion world live on Earth and depend on its biosphere and natural resources for their survival, Surprised
332,"I did n't that 's a ton of people , I wonder if an alien would be overwhelmed at the number of people on earth , like they would have to wonder how big of a planet this is and how it supports so much life", Curious to dive deeper
332,Good question . I read that the earth is the densest planet in the solar system and largest of the four terrestrial planets, Curious to dive deeper
332,"I could see that , what I really want is for scientists to find alien life in my lifetime though , we need to go back to the moon ! haha", Happy
333,"hi , do you know much about planet earth ?", Curious to dive deeper
333,atomic_number_53 know that 80 percent of our forests have already been destroyed, Sad
333,yeah and that is so sad . did you know the day used to be 5.5 hours only ?, Curious to dive deeper
333,It is really sad considering that humans have only been here a minute if earth 's history was viewed as a 24 hour period . I did not know that about the day being so short, Surprised
333,Yeah when you think about it it makes it ever sadder to what we are doing to this planet, Curious to dive deeper
333,"Well , the UN has appointed an official ambassador to extraterrestrials so hopefully we make some alien friends soon so we can move planets .", Surprised
333,"haha , that would be kind of cool . apparently earth will be helium free past the end of this century", Curious to dive deeper
333,No more helium balloons ? Aww ..., Sad
333,"I know , but maybe it is for the better . do you like animals", Curious to dive deeper
333,I do n't really like them as pets but in nature yes . It 's sad that the dodo bird is extinct . I hope we stop destroying the earth and habitats for animals . The dodo bird was actually a sub family of pigeon ., Sad
333,Yeah and I think it was a nice looking bird . I hope so too . their finger_cymbals are lighter than their feathers, Curious to dive deeper
333,"Yeah , this is due to their bones being hollow .", Surprised
333,"yeah , I guess that ready sense for them since they need to fly", Curious to dive deeper
333,"Right . I think wild birds in Australia are neat but would probably drive me insane . They can mimic camera , car alarms , and chainsaw sounds .", Surprised
333,"hahaha I can imagine that , going out everytime to check if the car is fine", Curious to dive deeper
333,Another neat thing to observe would be a hummingbird stealing a spiderweb 's nest !, Surprised
333,they are so tiny and yet so smart, Curious to dive deeper
333,"Sorry , I meant stealing webs to repair their nests . Yeah , bird brains are tiny but they seem so intelligent !", Surprised
333,That is true . How do you feel almost cats ?, Curious to dive deeper
333,I do not really like them but there is ampere stray cat that is super sweet and cuddles with me even though I tell her no . It is pretty cute . How about you ?, Curious to dive deeper

334,I 'm more worried about making funny voices lol . We are hunt out of so many things on this earth . Did you know 80 percent of forests have been destroyed ?, Curious to dive deeper
334,"thats a sad thing to hear . but we still have a bunch , so imagine how many we used to have !", Surprised
334,I could n't imagine ! I wonder if that 's why some birds fly from Last_Frontier to Mexico without sleeping ?, Curious to dive deeper
334,"they have to get to the warm , and fast ! they must get tired making the long journey tho", Surprised
334,"I 'm sure they sleep for days haha . Birds are pretty smart . There are wilds birds in Australia that can mimic the legal of cameras , car alarms , and chainsaws .", Curious to dive deeper
334,That 's so funny . I wonder what their accents are like . Because birds have accents !, Neutral
334,"I 'm image british and american birds talking to each other lol . I would like to see that , but also hang out with cats in Taiwan .", Surprised
334,id beloved to hear a bird with a cockneyed British accent . do you like cats ?, Curious to dive deeper
334,"No I actually do n't really like cats lol , but you can hang out with them at a cafe in Taiwan . I think that would be interesting .", Curious to dive deeper
334,"that would be interesting , but i would avoid it , im allergic !", Neutral
334,Wise person you are ! stimulate you seen the godfather ? I guess the cat in the opening scene was a stray they found on set !, Curious to dive deeper
334,i in_reality havent but id love to . i wonder if they paid that cat SAG day rates, Neutral
334,"haha or in cat plow ? I envy the life of a cat , it spends most of its life sleeping lol .", Curious to dive deeper
334,"that would be playfulness , so much better than working all day long", Neutral
334,I agree ! Would you ever want a cat as your town mayor ?, Curious to dive deeper
334,haha it would about as useful as my current mayor .... what Town elected a cat ? ? ?, Surprised
334,"It was Talkeetna , Alaska ! I 'm going to reckon more into that now ! Have a great day . Awesome chat !", Curious to dive deeper
335,"Hello there , do you follow baseball or MLB much ?", Curious to dive deeper
335,"I do , although one have n't followed it much the past couple of years .", Happy
335,"I am the opposite , I have been following more closely these last few , especially this last season as my team almost made the world series .", Curious to dive deeper
335,"Oh , which team is that ? Is it the Cubs ? They were the first team to win back to back World Series .", Happy
335,"No , I am a fan of the Brewers , I have never seen them play in a series , one game away .", Curious to dive deeper
335,What was the longest at bat you 've ever seen ? There is some question as to what the longest at bat ever was ., Happy
335,"I do n't know probably only 20 pitches or so , but I figure the longest is pretty darn long . Did you know managers can technically play if needed ?", Curious to dive deeper
335,"I execute n't know that , but it makes sense . Also , apparently the longest at bat ever was 21 pitches .", Happy
335,"That is all , that does n't seem like very many considering a full count is minimal 5 pitches .", Curious to dive deeper
335,"Well , apparently there is some dispute . The 'story ' does n't match whatever game on record , but the story has been told for over 70 years .", Happy
335,"Yeah and I guess the records began being kept in 1988 , so who knows what it was before that .", Curious to dive deeper
335,"Yeah , I guess 1998 is considered the modern earned_run_average . Before that teams did n't watch stats too closely .", Happy
335,"That is crazy , that exercise n't see that long ago . I 'm sure there are all kinds of crazy records before then .", Curious to dive deeper
335,"Cy Young apparently won 435 games , now 200 is considered incredible .", Happy
335,"Holy cow that is a crazy amount of baseball games to win , not just start , but win .", Curious to dive deeper

336,"A lot of talent in the show , there is a natgeo show send_for Game of Lions , seems like a fun show to watch lol", Curious to dive deeper
336,Well another good decision aside from the scene the director made is to film it in ireland . They actually get financed by ireland since the film would encourage touristry, Neutral
336,"I wonder if that strategy works for the country , I guess it does since many people around the world watch the show", Curious to dive deeper
336,I 'm sure it does . Which arcs did you enjoy the most of got, Neutral
336,"I liked the second story arc , that one was amazing what about you ?", Curious to dive deeper

336,Are you excited for the 8th harden ?, Neutral
336,"I am , too bad its going to be the final one but I guess the show will leave on a high note", Happy
336,"Honestly , I have no clue how they are going to fit all the action and story into 1 season when information_technology took 7 to get here . I just hope it does n't feel rushed or left a a cliff hanger . In any case , since the 3rd arc focuses on the legendary dangers of the north threatening the known realm , there will be a battle to remember", Neutral
336,"Thats a sure thing , it will be a battle to remember and it feels rushed , theres a lot more the show can give us , I like how Arya acts as well , she has become a badass", Curious to dive deeper
336,I guess it is due to her success that the diagnose Arya is rapidly becoming the popular girl baby name, Neutral
336,Its funny how a show fanny have an influence even on things like that one, Curious to dive deeper
336,"Indeed . In any case , thank you for the enjoyable chat about got and I hope you enjoy the 8th season", Neutral

337,Eight seasons ? That means it came out in 2011 . That is a long time for a show to be on and still being successful ., Neutral
337,"Yeah , that long . It has a big following , so much so that Arya the name of one of the characters is the fastest rising baby name for girls in the U.S .", Surprised
337,That is a little disturbing . Not sure I would name my kid from a TV show . I think the actor that played Arya was really her first role in anything ., Surprised
337,"I know right . I would n't either , but some people are very big fans . Lol", Surprised
337,I 'm not that big of a fan of anything . Lots of celebrities are overrated . In 2007 Paris Hilton was voted the most overrated celebrity ., Neutral

337,"I did n't know he was responsible foe that at all . That is very interesting , but I did know he was the voice of Genie . The guy was a national treasure .", Surprised
337,"Yes , he was , gone much too soon . Well , it 's been nice talking with you this morning . I hope you have a good day .", Happy

339,I think so . Do you know much about the universe ?, Curious to dive deeper
339,"I love_life reading about the universe its one of my passions , what about yourself ?", Curious to dive deeper
339,I feel the same way . There are scientists who think the universes evolve through natural selection like species here on Earth ., Surprised
339,"That is an interesting possibility , they might be on to something , there is also a theory that states that the universe is one giant super hologram .", Curious to dive deeper
339,Interesting ... a giant hologram ! I saw there are stars cold enough to be touched by human hands ., Surprised
339,"That is also a cool fact , then there 's also the theory that there 's only one electron in the universe .", Curious to dive deeper

340,"I believe information_technology the universe is huge , earth is also 4.5 billion years old .", Curious to dive deeper
340,"that is crazy , I did n't know that uranus rolls around sideways in its orbit instead of just spinning like Earth does", Surprised
340,"Interesting , What is kind of sad is that 80 percent of earths forests have personify destroyed .", Sad
340,"yes that is sad , also crazy that when the earth was made a day was only about 6 hours long , thats a super fast day !", Surprised
340,"Wow , likewise interesting is the core is molten lava but the caps are ice !", Curious to dive deeper
340,"ya that is interesting , it 's scary to me that we wilsl run out of helium by the end of this century , I know that it 's very important for manufacturing electronics", Surprised
340,"That cant glucinium good , hopefully they invent a way to create it .", Surprised
340,"yes I agree , crazy that we will run out of helium merely humans have only been on this planet for about a minute if you count the planet 's history as a 24 hour day", Surprised
340,That is not very long at all ! There is a major_planet where it rains glass !, Curious to dive deeper
340,"ha that would constitute wild to see ! I wondder if that planet has aliens ? I guess firefighters are trained on how to treat aliens in case they ever visit , which seems like a waste of time haha", Surprised
340,"I guess beneficial safe than sorry , Jupiter 's moon would be considered a planet if it orbited the sun .", Curious to dive deeper
340,"that is crazy , also with venus , I do n't know if you know , but it has no seasons and is the only planet to spin clock wise , the rest spin counter clockwise", Surprised
340,"I did non know that , The name of Jupiter 's moon is Ganymede , kind of odd huh ?", Curious to dive deeper

341,Earth is the third planet from the sun and it is the only satellite to have water in liquid form ., Happy
341,"Yeah and Earth 's surface is covered by about 71 % water , mostly oceans .", Curious to dive deeper
341,Only 3 % water_supply is fresh water which is used for drinking . Earth has one natural satellite is Moon . The earth receives its light and heat from the sun ., Happy
341,Yeah and scientists say that earth will be virtually helium free by the end of the 21st century1 Crazy !, Surprised
341,The earth spins on its own axis it causes for the day and night changes . If day in one part of the earth may be other part of earth have night ., Curious to dive deeper
341,"Earth 's axis is tilted with respect to it 's orbital plane , producing seasons . Thank good for seasons . My favorite is Spring !", Happy
341,The layer of the lithosphere is the upper most layer . Almost 71 % of earth surface is covered with water remaining 29 % is of water . The polar region are covered with snow or ice ., Happy
341,Hm . The planet Uranus actually rotates sideways and `` rolls '' around the sun rather than `` spinning '' like other major_planet !, Surprised
341,Very interesting . Already 80 % of forest area in the world has been destroyed which results in global warming and clime changes and affects the green houses of the environment . Lot of pollution also ., Happy
341,"Yeah , sadly mostly human activities are to blame for that , including massive deforestation for many reasons .", Sad
341,"Planet is a term that has been used since ancient times in the context of history , astrology , science , mythology and religion . There are five planets visible to naked eyes in the solar system .", Happy

341,Jupiter is the only planet which largest amount of artfical satellite ., Curious to dive deeper
341,"I think Earth is the planet with the largest amount of artificial satellites . Jupiter likely has the largest natural satellites , which we call moons .", Neutral
341,Earth has only 1 natural satellite is moon ., Curious to dive deeper
341,"Yes that 's true . Sometimes the moon is called Luna . The moon is creditworthy for making the earth 's tides , via the tidal bulge of the planet .", Neutral

342,Do you truly believe unknown exist ?, Neutral
342,Yes I do . I do n't think we are all alone in this universe . What do you think ?, Curious to dive deeper
342,To be dependable it has to be possible think about all the species of animals especially the ones we do n't even know about in the ocean . Dolphins are already smarter then us so how could aliens not exist, Happy
342,"I so believe we 'll eventually find some . But , I feel kind of the_likes_of Stephen Hawking , it 's dangerous to be communicating with them .", Fearful
342,But what if people like stephan hawking understood things we dont ' he is on another level of intelligence kind of like elon musk they are the human versions of aliens with their brains, Curious to dive deeper
342,"I agree with you about that . If we found some aliens , I 'd say let 's watch them for a good long time before any attempts at communication and they probably feel the same way about communicating with us .", Curious to dive deeper
342,"Exactly if aliens wanted to harm us they could have easily already have done it , they do n't want to interfere with us we should n't interfere with them", Neutral
342,"I agree , there 's something to it , though when the UN has a contigency plan in place should aliens ever attempt to contact the Earth . So , somebody knows something , they just ca n't alert the masses and create panic around the world .", Curious to dive deeper
342,So true and do n't you find it wierd how drones were first military technology and then a couple of years later it becomes available to the public . Where did the military steal their ideas from drone technology from ?, Happy
342,"The same place they stole a whole bunch of their other `` ideas '' . It 's just a matter of time , but hopefully Trump will have his Space force up and running by then . Lol", Curious to dive deeper
342,We 're getting into alex jones and joe rogan territory here lol you should watch that on youtube so you can have a good laugh, Surprised
342,"I 'll have to check it stunned , for sure . On a side note , I hear that the Hudson Bay region of Canada has less gravity than the rest of Earth . Wonder why ?", Curious to dive deeper
342,Might have something to do with magnetic fields we need to get neil degrasse tyson on the case he 'll cipher it out, Curious to dive deeper
342,"Lol , I 'm just wondering , will I be lighter on my feet thither ? And will the weight of the world not feel like its on my shoulders ? Asking for a friend .", Curious to dive deeper

343,Yeah . I am not sure that 's a full-time job . `` Any aliens today ? '' `` No . '' `` See you tomorrow ! '', Happy

343,"Can helium be created in a lab ? On a personal note , I have two helium balloons stuck in my vaulted ceiling . That helium lasts for at least 3 weeks . It is getting tiresome . ]", Angry
343,"In 2007 Tom Cruise spent millions on an underground bunker to protect himself from aliens . Maybe he knows some of the firefighters trained inwards treating aliens , in the event of a UFO crash . Or maybe he has a secret helium source .", Neutral
343,"As long as he is not jumping on the couches in his bunker , I am fine with it . He seems a little weird ...", Happy

343,disaffect were based of creatures found in the ocean ? I feel like there is a lot in the ocean we do not know about ., Curious to dive deeper

343,"You 're right , that 's not long at all !", Surprised

344,"I 'm not sure , it get_along n't seem like a real rule does it ?", Curious to dive deeper
344,It sounds bogus . Three bases ? I 've never heard of that . Somebody check the rule book ! Giamatti would not accept that rule ., Angry
344,"Yeah , some of the stuff you read is n't always truthful . Did you know that the Chicago Cubs were the first baseball team to win Back To Back World Series .", Curious to dive deeper
344,"The Cubbies , a sad story . How could they put on such a losing streak ? They signed a deal with the devil to win back to back , and then never win again .", Neutral

345,"Well , I 'm not an Astros fan , I 'm antiophthalmic_factor Cleveland Indians fan . How about you ? What baseball city you like ?", Curious to dive deeper
345,I 'm a Nationals fan . It seems like the Astros made a splashy move by not having to commit tens of millions of dollars in annual salary well into the next decade ., Curious to dive deeper
345,I hear ya .... do you think Gerrit Cole is deserving all the effort to get him ?, Curious to dive deeper
345,"I 'm not sure , probably not , but have 's see . Did you know that the managers wear uniforms because they technically are allowed to play ?", Curious to dive deeper
345,I never new the managers could also play . Ca n't remember that happening in ages . I always sort of liked Justin Verlander when he cost with the Tigers . The Indians always kicked his butt ., Curious to dive deeper
345,"Yeah . The Nationals have Bryce Harper , he had a bad yr last year , but he is still very highly paid .", Curious to dive deeper
345,"Very true . I was rooting for the Nationals last year , but man they hit the wall late in the baseball flavor . What happened ?", Curious to dive deeper
345,"It happens all the time . Crazy , they simply ca n't close the deal .", Curious to dive deeper
345,That sounds an awful like the Indians . I 'm 61 years old and have never seen them in a World Series . I 'm beginning to think I ne'er will ., Fearful
345,"Crazy . Well , they were in the film Major League .", Curious to dive deeper
345,LOL .... yep ... and with Charlie Sheen playing for them in that . Sheesh . Hey maybe the Nationals and the Tribe will play in the world series this year .... ya never know ?, Curious to dive deeper
345,That would be cool . make_out you know that up until 2005 a married couple scheduled all of the games for the year ?, Curious to dive deeper
345,I 've never get_word that before ! I wondered what happened after 2005 ? Did that married couple get divorced for arguing baseball games ... lol, Curious to dive deeper
345,"I 'm not sure , they credibly moved to some sort of automated system .", Curious to dive deeper
345,"Well , that would explain why the Indians play so many silly early baseball games in wintery Cleveland in the early season . calculator must not know weather .", Curious to dive deeper
345,Very true . Did you know somebody found $ 3 million dollars worth of 1900s baseball cards in his granddad attic ?, Curious to dive deeper

346,Yes baseball is so popular in Japan many people are surprise to find that it is our national game, Curious to dive deeper
346,I would be surprised too . Kickball is known every_bit soccer-baseball in Canada . That is odd ., Surprised
346,"Yes . I have had a few baseball cards in my day , but one favourable man found his grandfather had saved 3 million dollars worth of cards !", Curious to dive deeper
346,3 million is probably more money that I will ever have . The only things that my grandparents collect are rocks from their childhood . I do no think that those John_Rock will ever be worth 3 million !, Neutral
346,jest for sure ! Maybe you should try to be a team manager - they wear uniforms because theoretically they could put themselves in the game and play !, Curious to dive deeper
346,Really ? Although I make not think any of them have ever stepped in . I think that the actual players are much better than the coaches ., Surprised
346,No doubt but it would represent fun to see one to step in for an inning - perhaps in the world series championship game, Curious to dive deeper
346,"Speaking of the world series , the Ottoman Empire still existed since the last time that the Chicago cubs won the world series !", Surprised
346,That was until a few years ago ! That was a great year . The curse of the Goat !, Neutral

346,The Cubs did not let a man bring his goat into a baseball_game game around 1918 and he put a curse on them . It lasted almost a hundred years !, Neutral
346,"Ah , thank you . Speaking of the cubs , they were the very first team to win the world series back to back and they have not won since !", Surprised
346,Yes - even famous players can blow it sometimes too - Babe Ruth was caught stealing in game 7 and it caused his team_up to lose the 1926 world series, Curious to dive deeper
346,Really ? I though Babe Ruth was a renowned baseball player . I wonder why he would steal ., Surprised
346,Yes he was a big hitter but sometimes you need to steal a base ! He was a big guy though so probably not that flying, Curious to dive deeper
346,believably . Do you watch Game of Thrones ?, Curious to dive deeper
346,I have never seen it but I have heard a lot about it . It has received 47 emmy present so it must be pretty good, Curious to dive deeper

347,"haha that makes sense , do you use Spotify ? I only use youtube myself", Curious to dive deeper
347,"I use them all , Pandora , You Tube and Spotify . The all have there different purposes . Spotify has so many Sung that 20 % of them have never been played .", Curious to dive deeper

347,"no i have never paid for streaming music , I just use youtube , but I am on a google music trial right now , what about you ?", Curious to dive deeper
347,"I have not paid for anything either , just Netflix .", Neutral

352,"Yes , first team to win back-to-back World Series and not another one for 108 years ( Ottoman Empire was still in existence when they last won a World Series ? ) , that ironic . As a St. Louis fan growing up I did go to quite a few games at Wrigley Field along the way before they had lights which made a good afternoon .

Yes , I collected and bought some rare cards at a shop and know have no idea where they album are , a luck garbage collector might have found them when my mom cleaned out the attic long after I moved out . Being in Red Sox land , there 's always the ghost of Babe Ruth , when you look at the big guy he does n't look fleet of foot , bunny he lost the '26 World series getting caught trying to steal home down by one run . suspicious thought , though I doubt Yankee fans thought that , that year .", Curious to dive deeper
352,"wow , you collected those too ! I am amazed those cards lasted hidden since the 1940 's ! !", Happy
352,"Yes , I think every kid 1940-19808 probably did . You see where in the '92 World Series the US Marine Corp coloring_material guard carried the flag upside down , I wonder if that was planned to psyche them out or distract them from the game plan or totally an accident ?", Curious to dive deeper
352,I would be funny if it was an accident .. You lknow ? I really like hoe the world series are played .. It is not just one game .. you get a seven game playoff and the upheaval lasts more than other sports !, Happy
352,"Yes , that makes it fairer to the best team . You can win on a fluke shot or play in one game ( i.e . Super Bowl , NCAA Champion ) , but to win 4 or 7 is more skill . I am a Royals fan and they Won the World Series 4-5 years ago and then lost all their best players to free agency or like Justin Verlander lead the Tigers and going to the Astro 's . With small market teams the skill is n't always evenly distributed around the league .", Curious to dive deeper
352,Yes that is kind of sad .. and Verlander helped so much the Astros to win .. it was the right move .. for the Astros, Curious to dive deeper
352,"Yes , there 's two sides to every story . Though small market teams do n't have the draw of the Yankee 's or Dodgers , you see where the Women 's World Cup had higher TV rating than the World Series in the the_States last year ?", Curious to dive deeper
352,I am adenine soccer fan and the womens world cup grew a lot in popularity since the last one ! But I was shocked to learn that is was watched more than the world series ! !, Surprised
352,"So was 1 , speaking of fans . My wife loves Game of Thrones , we 're binge watching it getting ready for the final season , do you watch it ? It has some great blood lines , did you see where Charles Dickens great-great-great grandson and Charlie Chaplin 's granddaughter are both actors on the HBO Series ?", Curious to dive deeper
352,I do not watch but I know is really really popular ! ! Even made the identify Arya very popular in new baby girls ., Happy
352,"Yes , that crazy to me . I like the show O.K. , buy my wife is so enthused she 'd probably name a kid after one of the shows characters ( both our kids are out college , there 's no risk in that ) . It is beautifully filmed , financed by Ireland with some many scenes set there and Croatia , Canada , Malta and all the other places they filmed it makes for some beautiful scenery for all the sets .", Curious to dive deeper
352,"LOL wow it is film in really beautiful places ! ! ! I probably will create a game of thrones tour and visit all those places including the sites in Spain , Scottland , Morocco ! !", Happy
352,"atomic_number_53 assure you they already have it in Ireland and soon , if not already there will be cruise lines offering Game of Thrones Themed world cruises . You do n't follow the show , but the Lannister 's are an evil clan ruling the throne ( illegitimately some would say ) for many years and Martin , the author of the book said ( funny living in Boston area ) the Patriots are the Lannister 's of the NFL which I think is n't a totally false and funny analogy .", Curious to dive deeper
352,LOL ! ! I will probably watch Game of Lions ! ! You know I have enjoyed this chat very a_good_deal ! ! Cool facts about baseball history !, Happy
352,"Yes , I enjoyed the wide ranging discussion too . have_got a great remainder of your week .", Happy
353,Do you the_like baseball ?, Curious to dive deeper
353,"Yeah , I 'm a Royals fan . I thought it good_story that managers wear unis because they can play .", Surprised
353,"Yeah , I never thought that was possible , I think the whole team ingest to get injured first though", Curious to dive deeper
353,Can you imagine someone like Tommy Lasorda playing . It would be like Babe Ruth getting caught slip in the 1926 World Series ., Angry
353,"Yeah I can imagine the scenario , Babe Ruth sure was a gravid player , too bad his team lost that game back in 1926", Curious to dive deeper
353,"Yep . Funny , kickball is called soccer-baseball in Canada .", Angry
353,"I see , so do you like to watch series ? have you watched Game of Thrones before ?", Curious to dive deeper
353,"Yes and yes ... I love GoT , it 's a guilty pleasure of mine . I was surprised to learn that Harry Lloyd was a relative of Charles Dickens . Love Charles Dickens ...", Surprised
353,"That is a suprising fact are they really related ? guess theres no doubt where his talent comes from , you know the series are financed in part by Ireland", Surprised
353,I heard that . There are More famous connections too . Talisa is the granddaughter of Talisa . Wow ., Surprised
353,"I wonder if they knew these facts when they casted the actors of the show , it seems like there 's a lot of interesting facts behind the series", Curious to dive deeper
353,"I 'm sure they let it slip out during the casting . GoT now has spin offs , a Nat ' l Geo show called Game of Lions where lions are like GoT characters .", Surprised
353,"Havent seen that one merely sounds like an interesting show for sure , Game of Lions , I wonder how its similar to the series", Curious to dive deeper
353,I ca n't imagine costuming lions like that . Can you believe the women 's World Cup had better ratings than the World Series in the U.S. ?, Surprised
353,"It did ? maybe because the womens team is pretty good , they always land in a good spot , still , its surprising as baseball is one of the most popular games in America", Curious to dive deeper
353,"Yeah , I guess baseball_game is so popular in Japan that they were surprised to find out it 's America 's national pastime .", Surprised
353,"Yes Japan has a sight of fans indeed , do you know who the Chicago Cubs are ?", Curious to dive deeper
353,"Yeah , until they won in 2016 , the Ottoman Empire was still in existence the last time they won the macrocosm Series .", Surprised
353,"I heard they had a big drought before that , its strange how the team was the first to win the series back to back", Curious to dive deeper
353,It was long for sure . I was glad to see them beat the Indians in 2016 . It was like that had adenine curse or something like in GoT ., Surprised
353,"Yeah IT sure seemed that way , its a good thing the curse got lift .", Curious to dive deeper
354,"Hi , how are you doing tonight ?", Neutral
354,"Hi , I 'm trying to learn what the word `` accoutrements '' means , do you have any estimate ?", Curious to dive deeper
354,What are you learning that word for ?, Curious to dive deeper
354,"Well , it 's a new tactic that video game companies are tyring to employ to entice gamers .", Neutral
354,"Oh , you mean you need to buy extra and accessories in enjoin to enjoy the game fully ? Pretty sneaky .", Neutral
354,"I suppose , do you play video games on consoles like the PlayStation ?", Curious to dive deeper
354,I used to dramatic_play video games a lot as a kid . Do n't play now . No time . Little interest . Do you like to play ?, Curious to dive deeper
354,"No , but the US department of defense used over a thousand of those consoles to build a supercomputer because it was cheaper than the alternate ! That sounds like massive processing power !", Surprised
354,That 's a smart way to go . Scale up simple units to get the power . I do n't really know the PS . Are n't they up to PS4 or something ?, Neutral
354,"Not sure since I do n't play as well either , all I know is that it is created and owned by Sony WHO launched it in Japan . They were so popular and successful that they 've sold at least over 100 million units ! Wonder what X-box 's numbers are .", Surprised
354,Sony has made a great platform . Are the games good ? ordinarily that drives the sales of the machine . Are the games on all the platforms now ?, Curious to dive deeper
354,"Not sure since those console_table can be used for research purposes , like researchers are using them to research black holes , maybe they are not only used for games .", Surprised
354,I did hear that the military used the controllers for training troops on equipment . Very intuitive . They learned fast . I do n't know why black holes for research though . Why non regular computers ?, Neutral
354,Probably since it was flash like the supercomputer they built out of the consoles . I wonder if I went on YouTube whether or not I could learn how to build a supercomputer as well . Do you use YouTube ?, Curious to dive deeper
354,"That 's true . Cheaper . I sometimes utilize Youtube , usually for music .", Neutral
354,I manage the same for those purposes as well and for DIY videos which I think is a large reason why its the second largest search engine on the net !, Surprised
354,"DIY videos ? Sounds interesting . Why is Justin Bieber 's `` baby '' is the most disliked video on youtube ? Why the hate ? I do n't like the guy , but what 's the point ?", Neutral
354,"Yeah exactly , like Facebook , they should probably take away that dislike button and spread a little bit more positivity ! Unless it 's because his die-hard fans cost sad that he is n't a `` Baby '' anymore . fans do get crazy sometimes .", Surprised
354,I 'm not really up to speed on the new music . I guess I 'm getting old . I use Youtube to find my favorites from the old days ., Neutral
354,"Not sole do they have songs , they even have music videos , backstage access , audio recordings , etc . so you can find them all on there , even the oldies but goodies !", Happy
354,"That 's great ! Police actually have their own youtube called blutube , where they share law enforcement videos . I wonder if there are any secrets there that would be good to know . `` How to get out of a ticket . ''", Curious to dive deeper
354,"I marvel if there were videos whether or not they 'd actually work . Great chat , have a nice day !", Happy
355,"hello , do you happen to have a pet ?", Curious to dive deeper
355,"No , I do n't own a pet . I do like dogs , though . Do you own a pet ?", Curious to dive deeper
355,"I have a dog , its interesting how there about 12 different blood types , my dog is a donor and I never knew this fact .", Surprised
355,I 've heard that there are dog blood drives . I guesswork the dogs are ok with having a needle in their leg ., Neutral
355,"I guess so , some of them might be afraid , you know Google prefers dogs over cats , they are a dog keep_company .", Curious to dive deeper
355,It 's probably easier to manage dogs in an function space . Cats wo n't stay put ., Neutral
355,"I agree but cats spend like 66 % of their lives sleeping , when they reach the age of 15 they have spent 10 of those years sleeping .", Curious to dive deeper
355,"When they 're asleep , they 're easy to manage . Once they 're awake , they wander and explore . Cats would be great if they would sit at a computer and surf the Internet . Istanbul has vending machines that reward dogs for collecting recycled bottles .", Neutral
355,"I wonder if thats an effective system , I think it might work and its a way to reduce costs for indisputable .", Curious to dive deeper
355,I 've never been to a cat cafe . There are many of them in Japan and Taiwan . I guess the cats get along with each other and do n't have a problem with people trying to pet them ., Neutral
355,"Yeah I guess cats are popular in those countries , there is an author that published his cat as the coauthor of his book .", Curious to dive deeper
355,"I think he wanted to use the Holy_Scripture `` we '' in the paper , so he included his cat as an author . I wonder how a cat got to be the mayor of a town .", Neutral
355,"I bet the other politicians were really bad lol , still think mayor Stubbs will do a better work than most politicians .", Curious to dive deeper
355,"A cat could n't really do much harm . Sleeps most of the time . Rest of the time they hunt . Cats have eliminated the bird species of specific areas , still caused extinction .", Neutral
355,"They have ? wow that personify suprising , you know the cat in godfather 1 was actually a strayed one .", Surprised
355,It was a pretty well-behaved cat . I do n't think cats will ever be called `` man 's best friend '' but they sure come close ., Neutral
355,"I dont think that either , you know dogs exist actually not color blind , they can also see colors but not in the way we do .", Curious to dive deeper
355,"I 'm not surprised . I suspect that many animals can see color , just not like human beings For example , I expect that cats can see color as well .", Neutral
355,"I see , I didnt know cats could likewise see colors that is surprising to me !", Curious to dive deeper
355,Cats probably also have many different blood types . I wonder whether they have stock drives the same as for dogs ., Neutral
355,"I bet there are , I mean there are a lot of people who love cats so its really likely .", Neutral
356,I was reading that Jazz trumpeters grew goatees as it provides comfort when they are playing . I never knew that and found it interesting ., Curious to dive deeper
356,"That is interesting , so they started it for comfort over style and_then .", Curious to dive deeper
356,I guess . I once had a neighbor who was into jazz and would play . He was pretty good . A harlem woman has free concerts at her apartment for the past 20 years and sometimes top performers will stop over . What fun !, Happy
356,"That would be fun , and its sounds like her neighbors all like it if it 's been happening for 20 years !", Curious to dive deeper
356,Did you know that Anthony_Wayne Rooney is considering signing with DC United, Curious to dive deeper
356,"Yeah ace think he did sign with them actually , this must be a bit dated . I think that is the new norm now with stars coming to the US to end their careers .", Curious to dive deeper
356,I realize he is not the only one to come to the US . He did sign that is interesting . Do you follow sports much . I do not which is why I had not known ., Curious to dive deeper
356,I do follow sports so that is why I knew . I am a big fan of english conference football actually ., Curious to dive deeper
356,That is wonderful ! So DC link_up is a team in the US . Is the game played the same here in the US and in England ?, Curious to dive deeper
356,Yeah they are an MLS which is the American soccer league . The game is played the same elbow_room but we have a playoffs here instead of top of table wins the league ., Curious to dive deeper
356,"I think that soccer is a great sport and while I do not follow , I think it is a lot better than american football is . I would imagine that he is a good player as they did want him badly .", Curious to dive deeper
356,"Yeah he is a good player and I think he has represent doing good for them so far . And I agree , and I think american football is far more dangerous a sport to play .", Curious to dive deeper
356,It sure_enough is . Soccer is such a popular sport all around the world . I guess a player named Mesut Ozil donated his earnings from a bonus in the World Cup to pay for 23 children in Brazil to have surgeries . What a nice thing to do ., Surprised
356,"I read that , I think that is such a cool thing to do . I know he has been in a tough situation with his national team A of late as well .", Curious to dive deeper
356,That is too bad for him . Hopefully things turn around . I always wondered why americans call it soccer and I take that is because it was the slang for Association Football . Such a simple reason ., Surprised
356,"Yeah I guess it started as a slang term and just caught on for some reason here , I think its stupid that we named american football , football , because most of it is played with our hands !", Curious to dive deeper
356,"Ha , ha , I always wondered that as well . It does not make any sense . Honestly I am surprised that soccer is not more popular here in the US Did you read that there is a variation of soccer where trinity teams play at the same time . That must be crazy .", Surprised
356,"Yeah I think I heard about that one time . I think people here think its too boring because of the score , but it really is the most exciting . And then I think that they think they need to come up with new games or ways to play to make it more exciting .", Curious to dive deeper
356,Yes that might be thence . Reading about hats and I see birthday hats were derived from dunce hats to encourage foolish behaviour at parties ., Surprised
356,That is pretty interesting . Did you know the same type of plastic they make legos with is used to make hard hats ?, Curious to dive deeper
356,"Wow , I never knew that . Funny that they limited hat pins to a certain length , afraid women would use them as weapons .", Surprised
356,"yea that is funny ! Well its been nice talking with you , I hope you have a good night .", Happy
357,Good morning ! Do you like dogs ?, Surprised
357,"I do , I have a dog at home and a cat . How about you ?", Curious to dive deeper
357,"I love dogs . I have one as well , and it 's so smart it can understand pointing . I estimate dogs and elephants can do that .", Surprised
357,"Yeah they are smart . Did you know that they are not color blind , merely they ca n't see as many different colors as humans ?", Curious to dive deeper
357,"I did n't know that , but that 's cool . Did you know google prefers dogs to cats ?", Surprised
357,I 've heard that their code of conduct specifically states that . That 's pretty cool !, Curious to dive deeper
357,"Speaking of cats , when a cat reaches 15 , they 've spent 10 of it sleeping . Must be dainty !", Curious to dive deeper
357,That 's funny . Did you know there 's a Town in Alaska has had a cat as its mayor since 1997 ., Curious to dive deeper
357,"They have my vote ! Cats are famous sometimes , even one from the Godfather part 1 that was a stray on set !", Surprised
357,Did you know there 's cat cafe 's in Japan and Taiwan where people can pay hourly to play with cats and have drinks . I wonder if that would start over well here ., Curious to dive deeper
357,"I think it would with dogs , since they perform many roles for humans !", Surprised
357,I did n't cognise that they have 12 different blood types ., Surprised
357,Me neither ! They also have firedog blood drives for them to donate to !, Surprised
357,I need to use_up my dog to one . I give blood all the time so he should too ., Curious to dive deeper
357,I 'm sure he would save many dog 's spirit ! I wish I lived in Hawaii as far as business attire goes !, Surprised
357,atomic_number_53 'd like wearing an Aloha shirt instead of my uniform . I dress pretty much like Billy Mays ' pallbearers . Blue shirt and khaki pants ., Curious to dive deeper
357,That is one nice style you have there ! I wear polo shirts but did n't know they were invented for tennis players !, Surprised
357,I never knew that either . They were invented by Rene `` The Crocodile '' Lacoste ., Curious to dive deeper
357,"What a nickname ! I can see why it was later adopted by polo players , hence the name !", Surprised
357,"Yeah I can see that too . In China during the cultural revolution , gang fashion involved layering as many shirts as you could and popping their coloring_material . That 's a fashion that I 'm glad died .", Curious to dive deeper
357,"I am too . I always laughed at those people . Well it was nice chatting with you , have a great day !", Curious to dive deeper
358,Hi do you like cats ? They are definitely commodity at hunting vermin !, Curious to dive deeper
358,Agreed . I do love cats as well as most pets ! Did you know the cat used in the opening scene of The Godfather was actually a stray they found on set ? I thought that was pretty assuredness !, Neutral
358,Oh that is super assuredness . From rags to riches . A cats life must be nice . They spend over half their life sleeping !, Surprised
358,That the_States true . Ha ! I would like to visit one of those cat cafes over in Japan that lets you pay by the hour to drink and play with cats ! I bet that 's so interesting !, Neutral
358,That would be fun ! Also there is a town in Alaska that has a CT mayor !, Surprised
358,Is that so ? That 's a little odd ! Ha ! Did you ever hear some the physicist that published his cat as coauthor so he could avoid criticism by writing in first person plural ?, Neutral
358,Haha I never knew about that . However I also like dogs besides . They were the first species to be domesticated !, Surprised
358,"I love dogs as well ! It 's crazy only dogs and elephants are the only animals that can understand pointing , is n't it ?", Surprised
358,Yeah I agree I would think more animals would understand that . Google also prefers dogs to cats which be kind of funny that they declare such a thing ., Happy
358,"I know , right ? I wonder if they have vending machines around their buildings that releases water and food in exchange for bottles like Istanbul does . It 'd personify nice if our country could do that !", Curious to dive deeper
358,Yeah probably not a ton of strays in Palo Alto ! But yeah I think that is a cool_off idea to promote recycling ., Neutral
358,Agreed and help stray dogs as considerably . I also think its crazy that dogs ca n't see as many different colors as we humans can ., Surprised
358,Yeah that is interesting . I think it 's funny when owners put shirts on their dogs . They credibly put Hawaiian shirts on their dogs in Hawaii !, Curious to dive deeper
358,"Ha ! Probably so . You know , I 've always loved the term man 's best friend . They do so much for humans like companionship , hunting , protecting , pulling and even therapeutic roles , man 's best friend comprise the perfect term , in my opinion !", Happy
358,Yeah totally agree with you . Did you know that the official business attire in Aloha_State is the aloha shirt instead of a traditional suit and tie ?, Surprised
358,Is it really ? That 's kind of funny ! Ha ! I do know the pallbearers at Billy Mays ' funeral endure khakis and blue shirts . That was very nice of them ., Happy
358,Interesting . In china the gang layered as many shirts as possible and popped their collars !, Surprised
358,Now that 's interesting . Ha ! I also think it 's interesting that button down is when collar tips fasten to the body of the shirt and button up does not . I never really realized that !, Surprised
358,Yeah I did n't know that either . I always thought polo shirts were designed by polo players but they were originally invented by tennis players !, Surprised
358,"Were they really ? I figured polo players invented them as well . But you know , in American English , the term shirt is such a catch all term that represents a wide variety of upper body garments and level undergarments .", Surprised
358,Yeah I agree it does . In UK they have more specific definition of the word ., Curious to dive deeper
358,Yeah it 's more specifically a garner with a collar and sleeves with cuffs along with a full vertical opening with buttons . We would actually refer to it as a dress shirt . Ha ! comfortably it was great chatting with you ! Have a nice day !, Neutral
359,Many people enjoy chatting on the Internet . Do you ? Do you like computers ?, Curious to dive deeper
359,"I do actually , I use the calculator a lot . I just do not have that kind that the russians made that runs on water", Curious to dive deeper
359,"The water computer sounds alien , like something that Elon Musk would create . I wonder how fast that mend thing ran . As fast as Windows 8 maybe .", Neutral
359,"I am not sure since it was also a very long time ago , in 1936 .", Curious to dive deeper
359,"1936 . That was a great year for water computers . Since then , not so good . I expected the Russians to make one that ran on vodka , but then again , vodka is too precious for computers . WOuld you upload your mind to a computer ? If it ran on vodka , I would .", Neutral
359,No I do not think so but it seems transhumanists are trying to do that . Curious to look if they succeed, Curious to dive deeper

359,That sounds very probable . practise you have a PC or an Apple computer ?, Curious to dive deeper
359,I have a PC . I have used Apple stuff though . You ? Playstation ?, Neutral
359,yeah I have an Apple so I guess good thing that I am not a smoker so as not to void the warranty, Curious to dive deeper

359,"Yeah , right ? Do you watch youtube on your computer ?", Curious to dive deeper
359,I sometimes watch YouTube to catch up on news and documentaries . You ?, Neutral

360,"Sorry , to hear that . I have had a cat , she passed away last year and she was 18 years old . I believe she probably slept 16 out of those 18 years sleeping . lol", Happy
360,I did n't realize that they sleep so much or that there are over 70 breeds !, Surprised
360,"My cat was probably the easiest first_gear maintenance pet I ever had , A lot less needy than my dogs , for sure . Do own any pets ?", Curious to dive deeper
360,"The only pet I 've ever had are fish , though I do n't mind cats . I had antiophthalmic_factor friend in college who wants to open her own cat cafe like they have in Japan and Taiwan", Neutral
360,"Yeah , I heard about those cafes . People pay to have a drink and play with cats . Sounds like an easy way to construct money !", Surprised
360,I 'm not sure how easy that would be with all the food safety laws we have here in the US . Maybe that 's why it has n't become popular Hera ., Neutral
360,That 's true . Did you know that dogs have 12 different blood types and can donate at stemma drives ?, Curious to dive deeper
360,I wonder if their blood types work similarly to ours ? I know some dogs would be able to reach more blood than others based on their size, Neutral
360,"I 'm not sure , but they probably work the same , I 'd think . I 'm sure there 's a big need especially for dogs with cancers .", Curious to dive deeper
360,"I think it 's interesting how dogs and cats can be different , but both are useful for hunting", Neutral
360,That make_up interesting . It 's also interesting that Istanbul has vending machines that dispense water and food in exchange for recycled plastic bottles ., Surprised
360,That 's a genius way to take care of the strays while also encouraging recycling . I bet Google would donate to that type of initiative considering the company loves dog enough to have it in their code of conduct, Neutral
360,"Yeah , they are truly a dog company ! We need these machines atomic_number_49 America !", Surprised
360,"The stray cats could probably benefit from something like that as well . When filming the Godfather , the cat in the opening scene was actually a stray that wandered onto the set", Neutral
360,"That 's cool , cat was a movie star and did n't even know it . lol I wonder if the cat named Stubbs in Talkeetna , Alaska knows that its the mayor ?", Curious to dive deeper
360,"Since 1997 , nonetheless . That 's a long time for an animal to be in angstrom political position . There must not be a large population in that part of Alaska", Surprised
360,Probably held that position longer than some politicians . Do n't have to worry about too many scandals when you 're a cat !, Surprised
360,It 's about as funny as the physicist whose cat is a coauthor just so his grammar would be correct . It was easier to attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder the cat than to use first person singular rather than plural, Neutral
360,"That is funny too , You do n't have to worry about your grammar either , when you 're a cat . It 's been nice chatting with you this afternoon .", Happy

361,"Orlando has embraced mil too , I am quite surprised how popular it has become .", Neutral
361,I 'm with you 110 % on that . I have n't heard anyone talk about how embarrassing the Falcons are in weeks . It makes sense . We have n't ever really had a winner before . I 'm wondering if Rooney can still play or if this is like Beckham playing in LA when the MLS began ., Curious to dive deeper
361,"To switch gears for a moment , I 'm listening to Dizzy Gillespie at the moment . He always was axerophthol favorite of mine , a trumpet virtuoso . Did you now that jazz trumpeters often grow goatees because it provides comfort when they play their instrument ?", Curious to dive deeper
361,I did n't but I can see why that would be appealing.The facial hair I mean . I 've tried to like it but Jazz just does n't do much for me . New Orleans jazz is sort of the exception . I like the big brass sections . I do like zydeco and that has a lot of jazz influence ., Curious to dive deeper
361,"I definitely would say I prefer music that 's influenced by jazz , rather than jazz itself . Tom Waits is my favorite artist ever , and the influence of jazz is present on a lot of his work .", Curious to dive deeper
361,I agree with you about the influence it 's had on other music . It 's kind of funny that you brought up jazz actually . It 's such a mish mash of musical influences from around the world but it 's probably still the most original art form that the United States has ever produced . That 's sort of what we 've got going on with the capital_of_Georgia FC here ., Happy
361,Did you now that the term soccer came from `` association football '' ? I find that interesting . I always wondered why it was n't called something else ., Curious to dive deeper
361,I did n't know that . I 've wondered though . We 've got all of these sports fans here from different places with competing team loyalties . Except for soccer . Most of them never had a pro team that they grew up rooting for . They all grew up knowing something about that . I mean we 're talking 250 million players worldwide . Now these guys have a team to root for with no competing loyalties . It 's a more communal experience and it has taken polish_off around here ., Curious to dive deeper
361,"Do you ever go to live games ? It 's an experience I have only very recently had an opportunity to possibly enjoy , and yet I have n't . I wonder if I would enjoy it for the entire duration of the game .", Curious to dive deeper
361,I have n't gone yet but I 'm going to this coming season . My interest in early sports has waned so the timing is perfect . Get in on the ground floor of something special you know . It 's hard to pick up though . You would n't think it would you . A big stretch of grass with a goal on either side 's more complex than I thought . Theres way more people to talk about it with too . More than all the major American sports leagues combines in terms of fanbase ., Surprised
361,"Yep , it gives you something to talk about with so many people from different countries . I think that 's really cool . They really mean the `` world '' when they said the world cup , unlike the world series , which is just a national matchup . That 's interesting you say it 's tough to pick up . atomic_number_53 bet the best way to really learn about it would be to play FIFA video games .", Happy
361,Thats a good point about playing FIFA . That was my only exposure to the sport growing up . There 's a much lower barrier to entry to play the game in the real world . Probably part of it 's popularity . It 's kind of funny . The color scheme and the uniforms here kind of remind me of Harry Potter . I guess ridiculous hats are a thing in football circles . I do n't know how else to explain the goofy ones I 've seen around here after FC games ., Curious to dive deeper
361,"Sports fans are definitely responsible for more_or_less ridiculous hats , like the oversided cowboy hat , that 's like measured in gallons rather than regular hat size . I 'm not a hat guy myself , my head 's too big . Speaking of cowboy hats , in the old west , the cowboy hat was not the most common hat worn . It was actually the bowler , which truthfully is a lot classier looking in my opinion .", Curious to dive deeper
361,Billy the Kid was a bowler hat kind of guy . I like hats because I 'm bald . They keep the sweat out of my eyes and keep my head warm . Sports fans have changed headwear from a social status thing to more of a social group identity thing . Ironically the only times I 'm not likely to wear a hat is when it would be the most useful . I 've worked in construction most of my life but I could never bring_forth used to wearing a hard hat . Lucky I did n't get my brains scrambled ., Curious to dive deeper
361,"Goodness . Yeah , the only time I ever wore hats was when angstrom job required me to , for me to display whatever fast food logo I worked for . And with that thought , I will depart .", Curious to dive deeper
362,"howdy , how are you ?", Curious to dive deeper
362,I 'm good ! Do you utilisation youtube ?, Happy
362,I do utilization youtube . Do you ?, Curious to dive deeper
362,I do . I love it ! It 's where I first say Psy 's Gangnam Style video . Have you see_to_it it ?, Happy
362,I have not seen that one . I have n't seen Justin Beiber 's Baby either but that is probably good since it is the most disliked video on the platform ., Surprised
362,lol Poor Beib 's . Psy 's video got so many views on youtube that they had to upgrade the view count integer to 64 bits ., Happy
362,You tube is the 2nd largest search engine behind google . Make sense since google owns them ., Surprised
362,I believe that . Google bought youtube for $ 1.65 billion dollars ! That 's a lot of cash ., Happy
362,"That is ! Between youtube and netflix , they make up one-half of peak internet usage .", Surprised
362,I believe it ! People lovemaking videos ! Do you have a playstation ?, Happy
362,I kind of execute ... My son has one that I bought him . Do you have one ?, Curious to dive deeper
362,My kids do . I have no idea how to play it . lolol Playstation 3 's are being used to research black holes somehow ., Happy
362,riot . The DoD used 1760 of them to build a supercomputer ..., Surprised
362,"Wow . Who would have thought that ? lol The original grand theft auto game disc for playstation , when placed in a cd player would play the game soundtrack . Kind of neat .", Happy
362,That is cool . The last game produced for ps2 was fifa 14 . I had no idea ., Surprised
362,I did n't either ! lol Do you use computers a lot ? In 1936 the Russians made a computer that could run on water !, Happy
362,I do use them a lot . The space shuttlecock general purpose computer runs on 1 mb of ram ., Surprised
362,Wow . That 's pretty incredible to think about . Someone built a working 16 bit computer using nothing but the basic minecraft building blocks ., Happy
362,Maybe it was a transhumanist . They want to upload their mind to computers . I am not sure ane would want to do that ..., Fearful
362,ace would want to do it so my future generations of my descendants can look back at my life . Be interesting I think ., Happy
362,"With that perspective , yes . Nice chatting with you !", Happy
363,"Hi , how are you ? Do you like jazz ?", Neutral
363,Hi there ! Yeah I do like jazz ! Do you ?, Happy
363,"Yes , I love jazz . I am listening to some mightily now .", Neutral
363,"Ah nice ! Yeah Jazz is interesting to me simply because it originated in the African-American biotic_community of New Orleans . It 's definitely rare and unique , in my opinion .", Curious to dive deeper
363,"It certainly is . I think that it should be more popular , but it is too artistic . Not enough show business , too much art .", Neutral
363,Can you believe that Pakistan has a jazz orchestra that is currently topping the charts ? Wow jazz has made it 's way from freshly Orleans around the entire world !, Surprised
363,"Yes , even in Pakistan . I figure that there is value in all genres of music . Perhaps the rest of the world sees the value in jazz .", Neutral
363,"There certainly is value in all music , I agree ! Which reminds Maine that I just recently heard that Clint Eastwood is a lifelong jazz enthusiast , pianist , and he 's scored several films , including Million Dollar Baby !", Surprised
363,"He seems like a tough guy , but atomic_number_2 is an actor and artist so I 'm not surprised . He is not a very good singer though .", Neutral
363,"Haha , then maybe I should be happy I 've not heard him sing ! So I was reading about how jazz trumpeters grew goatees to make playing a bit more comfortable . I wonder if that is possibly the origin of goatees . Maybe , maybe not !", Surprised
363,"He sang at the end of Gran Turino . I think people tried all kinds of facial hair , but for brass , maybe it 's an obvious select .", Neutral
363,"Hm . I did watch that movie but iodin just ca n't remember him singing ! I 'll check it out again , since now I 'm pretty curious ! : )", Curious to dive deeper
363,Right at the end . Then another singer takes over . Clint writes good melodies though ., Neutral
363,Interesting to be able to write melodies but not be able to sing so well ! I pretty much have the opposite_word problem . Haha . Clint seems like such a new-age cowboy to me . Speaking of cowboys ! The most popular hat in the old west was the bowler hat and not even the cowboy hat !, Curious to dive deeper
363,I guess the bowler was style and class and the cowboy hat was a working hat ., Neutral
363,"Personally I prefer cowboy hats , especially since it 's associated with hard work , instead of just sophistication and such . : )", Happy
363,"Yes , they have their own kind of cool . the bowler looks close .", Neutral
363,"I agree ! I prefer hates for functionality such as protecting against weather conditions , sun , and even beanie 's for cold weather ! Beanies are technically hats , right ?", Curious to dive deeper
363,"Yes , sure . But dont wear one to a wedding though ! in_any_event , great chat !", Neutral
363,Yeah thanks ! It 's been great ! : ), Happy
363,You also !, Neutral
363,"Have a great day ! If it 's cold outside , make sure to wear a beanie ! : )", Happy
363,"yes , by all mean.s", Neutral
363,"It 's pretty sunny here , so I 'll maybe wear a baseball cap : ) Later !", Happy
363,au_revoir, Neutral
363,Bye : ), Happy
364,Hawaii ?, Neutral
364,Have you heard of visual novels such as `` Stay '' that run along game consoles like Xbox ?, Curious to dive deeper
364,"No , I have not . That sounds fascinating . How is that different from ampere movie ?", Neutral
364,"You interact with it . In fact if you ignore it , it taunts you . Intruders invade and all kinds of things happen .", Happy
364,That sounds like a great way to have fun . single bet the story line is pretty good too . You do n't kill things or earn points . Is it popular ?, Neutral
364,"I would infer so , it 's on many different consoles . In certain parts of the story there are minefields .", Curious to dive deeper
364,I guess I should look into this . Do you function Playstation ?, Neutral
364,No . The most significant thing is that it canful have different endings ., Neutral
364,I do n't really play video games much anymore . Do you ? Do you use computers much ? i do ., Neutral
364,I use computers a lot . Did you know Windows 95 was the 2nd most installed SW atomic_number_49 1995 ?, Curious to dive deeper
364,"W95 was huge for its time . It got delayed several times , but it was a big skip for Microsoft . I used it a lot myself .", Neutral
364,Me too . The first computer algorithm was written by a woman named Ada . I wonder if that 's where the name ADA came from in computing ., Curious to dive deeper
364,"Yes , I believe so . There was a programming language called ADA . I never used it . She was very bright .", Neutral
364,That 's what I was saying . It came from Pascal . Bell distributed a manual cardboard computer to HS students in 1968 to teach them how that works . I 'd be interested in seeing that ., Curious to dive deeper
364,I see . Pascal and ADA are related languages . Is it in use immediately ? I would n't expect so ., Neutral
364,"If I remember right , the gov't was pushing ADA . There 's in_all_likelihood a lot of legacy systems with it . Did you know the first YouTube video was some dude talking about an elephant ...", Curious to dive deeper
364,An elephant ? Not ADA ? LOL . I guess that makes sense . The first upload was probably pretty basic ., Neutral
364,Now there are seventy-nine full episodes of `` The Joy of Painting '' with Bob Ross ., Happy
364,"Yes , that man is a legend ! Encouraged so many people to try painting . There should be a paint program called Ross .", Neutral
364,yeah . Did you know the PS3 's only have 256MB of RAM ? That 's not much ..., Surprised
364,"That 's not much at all . I 'm surprised . Anyway , great chat !", Neutral
364,thank ., Neutral
365,Are you a fan of sleep_together ?, Curious to dive deeper
365,"hi how are you ? yes , i like bed . You ?", Neutral
365,I do . So does Clint Eastwood apparently ., Curious to dive deeper
365,"Yeah , he plays piano . he also composes too , ive heard .", Neutral
365,I practise n't know that . That is pretty cool ., Curious to dive deeper
365,"He is allergic to horses , i think , soh maybe he spends more time at the piano now .", Neutral
365,"Interesting , I wonder how he shot all of those films then ?", Curious to dive deeper
365,"I think he wasnt allergic at first , but then developed an allergy . maybe atomic_number_2 is getting treatment now ? i dont know", Neutral
365,Interesting . Who would own guessed ?, Curious to dive deeper
365,I wonder if clint knows that Pakistan has a jazz orchestra that is currently crown the charts ., Neutral
365,"I 'm non sure , but that is a good question . Do you like hats ?", Curious to dive deeper
365,"hats are good . stylish , functional . i dont wear them often . You ?", Neutral
365,"Nah , I cogitate they promote baldness . LOL", Curious to dive deeper
365,"good thing i dont wear them then . LOL . Im surprised that the most popular hat in the old west was the bowler , not the cowboy hat", Neutral
365,Interesting . I would have cogitate the cowboy hat myself ., Curious to dive deeper
365,"Yeah , maybe that is a working hat and people wanted to be stylish ? ace dont know .", Neutral
365,I 'm not sure to be honest . There was a law in 1908 that limited the duration of hairpins ., Curious to dive deeper
365,"male_child , those women and their hairpins ! LETHAL ! LOL i guess women did not carry guns then ? that would have been funny", Neutral
365,"Yeah , sounds pretty comical . Well , nice chatting with you !", Curious to dive deeper
365,"Yes , it has been great chatting ! I 'm glad that the server is back upwards ! Yay", Neutral
365,withdraw it easy !, Curious to dive deeper
366,Hello did you know the only fish to have a neck represent the seahorse ?, Curious to dive deeper
366,I never thought about it but that is interesting ! I am kind of frightened that there is a breed of jelly fish that are immortal . Yikes !, Surprised
366,"And lobster ! They are immortal in a sense that their organs dont age , so as long As nothing kills them they can technically live forever .", Curious to dive deeper
366,Yuck . I do n't like that at all . One of the most interesting fish is the balck swallower fish that can eat prey twice its own length and ten clock its weight . Sounds like one of those creepy snakes that eat huge animals ., Surprised
366,"Yuck ? Ah you dont like seadfood ? I love eating lobster lol I think that fish black swallow constitute amazing , to have the ability to have their body stretch like that , who knows when their next meal will come along .", Curious to dive deeper
366,I am allergic to shellfish ... maybe that is it . But can you believe this ... I named my son Fisher . So there is a little love there !, Happy
366,"oh thats too bad , sorry to hear . Haha black_cat , thats a great name . Freshwater fish drink water through their skin !", Curious to dive deeper
366,Interesting ! I just learned that there are about 20 quintillion individual animals on planet dry_land . Crazy !, Curious to dive deeper
366,Yeah and they are not even all discovered yet ! theres a bunch undiscovered animals and insects indium the amazon rainforest still ., Curious to dive deeper
366,The rainforest frightens Maine . Too many creatures ! I can only imagine how many insects are in there ! Did you know that animals develop white patches on their foreheads when they are domesticated ?, Curious to dive deeper
366,I didnt . I pretend I would never notice because my dog is white lol, Curious to dive deeper
366,That is funny . My dog has a white patch ... but not on it 's brow ! They say that hiccups are a holdover from early evolution when early land animals had gills and lungs ., Surprised
366,I kinda wish we still had gills lol That would be sweet to swim longer under water ., Curious to dive deeper
366,I agree ! Look ... I love my sleep but there are some birds who fly from alaska to northern mexico without sleeping when migrating . Exhausting !, Surprised
366,"I make_love right , thats incredible . I also love sleeping .", Curious to dive deeper
366,Naps are the best ! I like that hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nests . Where do you think they hide_out it ?, Surprised
366,The hummingbirds ? I have no clue lol Where do they hide ?, Curious to dive deeper
366,No ! I was asking where they hide the spiderweb when they are stealing it . I was trying to be funny . Did n't work ! LOL ! One fact is that birds bones are so hollow that the entire skeleton weighs less than the feathers !, Surprised
366,"Oh lol Thats horrible , i wouldnt deficiency hollow bones lol I guess it makes sense for them , they have to be light enough to fly", Curious to dive deeper
366,"True ! Good point ! In Australia there are wild birds that can mimic the sound of cameras , car alarms and chainsaws ! Creepy !", Surprised
366,wow that is really creepy ! I wonder what bird does that lol IT been fun chatting ., Curious to dive deeper
367,"hi , arrange you like soccer ?", Curious to dive deeper
367,To be honest I do n't like soccer . But I may watch the World Cup if the USA makes it to that point . What about you ?, Curious to dive deeper
367,Yeah I like it because it is so international . did you know the city where it will be hosted in 2022 does not exist yet, Curious to dive deeper
367,"That is crazy . Are you going to watch it ? I do n't know how they can just create a city out of nowhere and have it ready for 2022 , but we 'll see what happens", Curious to dive deeper
367,"Yeah atomic_number_53 am looking forward to it and yes , I do not know how that is going to work", Curious to dive deeper
367,I do like the United States and soccer though . They got third place back in 1930 which was the first FIFA World transfuse, Happy
367,"Nice , maybe they manage to climb back . you never know . The countries that host it do not have any net economic gains", Curious to dive deeper
367,Nope I heard about that . That 's why I wonder why they 're making an entire city for the World Cup . I guess the women 's soccer team is better than the men 's soccer team in the United States . Is that correct ?, Curious to dive deeper
367,"Yup , they seem to do much better . soccer players make more money than other sports combined , well the major ones", Curious to dive deeper
367,That is really crazy . I know that football the United States makes a ton of money too . I always wondered why Americans call it soccer . I guess that is slang for association football, Surprised
367,Yeah I imagine football means differnt things in many different countries, Curious to dive deeper
367,Yeah I think you 're right . I require to see the soccer variation with three teams . I bet that 's really insane, Surprised
367,yeah that would be interesting to know . a german soccer player donated his winning from the world cup to kids in brazil, Curious to dive deeper
367,Wow that 's really nice of him . I think it was something like three hundred thousand Euros ? And it personify paying for surgeries for those kids . That is so nice, Happy
367,that is super heartwarming . do you know jon stewart ?, Curious to dive deeper
367,I do know him . I believe he was on The Daily Show correct ?, Curious to dive deeper
367,Yeah he is and he was also a very skilled soccer player, Curious to dive deeper
367,I did n't know that . what are your thoughts on tom Hanks ?, Curious to dive deeper
367,I have_it_off the guy he is so talented . he is the highest box office star, Curious to dive deeper
367,Yep I agree . He has a lot of awesome movies . I guess he 's made almost 9 billion dollars worldwide with his film earnings . That is so much !, Happy
367,"Wow , that is insane . nice chat : )", Happy
368,"Hello there , coif you follow the MLS ?", Curious to dive deeper
368,"I do , I think Wayne Rooney is a great acquisition for the leage what virtually you ?", Curious to dive deeper
368,Yeah I think it was good not only for him and his family but for the league as a whole ., Curious to dive deeper
368,"I agree , he played at great teams and his an icon of soccer for sure , but there are other great players type_A well like Ibrahimovich", Curious to dive deeper
368,Yeah I think that has become the new norm is for global class players to end their careers here in the US ., Curious to dive deeper
368,"in_that_location is also another great player that played before Rooney his name is Roy Wegerle ,", Curious to dive deeper
368,Yeah I guess Roy was a hell of a participant . I guess he played for 5 different english clubs during his career ., Curious to dive deeper
368,"He sure was and wat about Eddie Johnson , his been a pro since age 16 , he sure has a good level of skill", Curious to dive deeper
368,Yeah Eddie Johnson and Freddi Adu were touted as being the next big things in soccer . They both had pretty good careers but not as big as hyped up to be ., Curious to dive deeper
368,"Well its hard since there is a lot of good players out there , sometimes its just a matter of luck , suffice you watch the last FIFA World Cup ?", Curious to dive deeper
368,Yeah I get so excited each summer the world cup comes around . How about you ?, Curious to dive deeper
368,"I did , I thought it was a great World Cup , I was rooting for Argentina but I guess France was the best team of the cup overall , I also liked how Croatia played .", Happy
368,"Yeah France had an amazing team and they finally played like it . Belgium , Croatia , and England did fairly well as well . I think Japan had some of the most exciting games to watch of all the teams .", Curious to dive deeper
368,"I agree , those teams were also pretty good and almost made it , Im exited about the World Cup thats going to be hosted in Qatar by 2022 and then In the US by 2026", Happy
368,Yeah the Qatar one will be too different for me though . watch the world cup in the middle of winter will be strange ., Curious to dive deeper
368,"It will be weird I bet the players wont notice it thouhg as Qatar must be really hot even on winter time , its too bad the American soccer team isnt as good in the male category as it is on the female one", Curious to dive deeper
368,Yeah the men 's team needed a whole rebuild . They have year to go before they are anywhere close to where the women 's team is ., Curious to dive deeper
368,"I agree , the womans team always place third or above , they must feature a lot of support from the government", Curious to dive deeper
368,That and I do n't think other countries around the world have the women 's programs in place like we do here in the US ., Curious to dive deeper
368,"Yeah I think they only support mens teams but who know even then the US team might be really great , do you know who Ozil is ?", Curious to dive deeper
368,"Yeah of course I do , I follow the english league very closely . How about you ?", Curious to dive deeper
368,"I do , I like the premier legue and also the Spain league , well Ozil danated his winning bonus on 2014 to children in Brazil so that they could get surgery", Happy
368,"Yeah I remember seeing that , very cool . Well it was nice talking with you , iodin hope you have a nice day .", Happy
369,hullo ., Happy
369,Hey ! How are you today ? Are you an animal person ? I live in Florida so we have a ton of wildlife . One I do n't like is jellyfish ! There is a breed that is immortal !, Surprised
369,I have never seen a jellyfish in person . I love animals though ., Happy
369,I have almost stepped on a few when they wash up on the beach . Scary stuff . Fish in general can be scary like the black swallower than can eat prey ten times its weight ., Fearful
369,Yeah and twice IT own length . Wonder where it puts it all ., Happy
369,"No kidding ! Only one Fish has a neck , the seahorse . That seems crazy to me !", Surprised
369,Did you know freshwater fish only drink water through their skin via osmosis ., Happy
369,"I did not know that ! I intend as animal lovers we would be happy in Germany . In 2002 , they universally gave animals constitutional rights .", Happy
369,I dont know about taking it that far . Seems like they ma be trying to make up for something over there in germany ., Happy
369,"Haha , very true . That is a lot of animals to give right to ! I do now know how many personify in Germany , but there are 20 quintillion individual animals on the planet !", Surprised
369,That is a boat load of animals huh ., Happy
369,I ca n't even comprehend that number ! It is sad so many go extinct like the dodo bird ., Sad
369,That is sad . Have you heard where hiccups ome from ., Happy
369,"Yes , I have actually . They are a holdover from long ago when the first_off land animals had both gills and lungs .", Neutral
369,Exactly what I was gon na say . Do you like wench ., Happy
369,"I do , we have a ton of those in Florida too ! They can trace birds back to 170 million years ago ! Wild !", Surprised
369,Some birds flee from alaska to mexico without sleeping when migrating ., Happy
369,That is a crazy fact ! Probably helps that their bones are really hollow and their skeleton weighs less than their feathers ., Neutral
369,That probably doe help ., Happy
369,"Yea , keeps them aerodynamic !", Neutral
369,I really do love birds . Ttyl ., Happy
370,Do you like sports ?, Neutral
370,"I 'm not really into sports , but soccer is n't bad . My friend is obsessed with it and was telling me about this guy Freddy Adu who became pro at 14 , I think", Neutral
370,Oh Tell me more, Curious to dive deeper
370,Apparently he unwell early though and never really became as great as he could be, Curious to dive deeper
370,That is a shame . Do you watch the world cup ?, Neutral
370,"No , but my boyfriend has been trying to get me to . He said I should start with women 's soccer because the female US squad has n't placed lower than third since they started in 1991 .", Neutral
370,"Despite the US not being as supportive of soccer as other sports , the us teams have done amazingly well in the world cups as you mentioned", Neutral
370,"Yeah , but i think Americans are getting tired of close_to of the US only sports . Soccer makes more money than football , basketball , baseball and golf combined .", Surprised
370,That is because soccer is the most popular internationally, Neutral
370,I asked my boyfriend why it 's called soccer hither and he said it was slang for association football in the states ., Neutral
370,"Honestly , football and american football confused the heck out of me when I was younger . Calling it soccer made it easier", Neutral
370,Maybe they should just call American football : stupid ball '' and get it over with . I take_heed the city set to host the fifa in 2022 does n't even exist yet ., Neutral
370,True many countries want to host contempt no immediate economic benefits, Neutral
370,"That 's really surprising , I heard there are no disceernable economic benefits to host the Olympics either . I guess the unscathed process is so taxing to the economy and people .", Neutral
370,"Perhaps but it also provides prestige , advertisement , tourism , and jobs so I guess it live worth it", Neutral
370,"I like that some of the player are altruistic at least , even if sports is mostly about money . I heard a German player donated his 300,000 FIFA win money to help kids in Brazil get surgery .", Neutral
370,That is very generous of him, Happy
370,I heard Jon Stewart was a footballer a well ., Neutral
370,I hope soccer continues to maintain such a healthy spirit despite allegations of corruption surrounding the league, Sad
370,I am sure it will only gain in popularity Eastern_Samoa Americans start looking outside the country for what 's new and different, Neutral
370,I agree . Thanks for your time ., Neutral
371,"Hawai'i , do you like wine ?", Curious to dive deeper
371,"I Master_of_Arts not a big wine drinker , I have it occasionally but sometimes it gives me very bad headaches .", Neutral
371,I guess Oregon wine is making a big push to be great ! I had no idea !, Surprised
371,"I know California is a major wine region , I guess the entire West Coast is a undecomposed place to have vineyards .", Surprised
371,Yeah . I really wishing to do a vineyard tour in Napa . Have you ever been ?, Curious to dive deeper
371,No I have not . I will be traveling to Portland this year so I may have to see these Oregon vineyards firsthand now ., Curious to dive deeper
371,Nice . My sister loves a vineyard in Oregon . I can not remember the name though . She got pretty drunk on it and spent like $ 500 on a few cases ., Happy
371,"I 'll have to watch how much wine I have , I do n't know if I have enough space in my luggage to bring a few cases home .", Surprised
371,"No , she had them mailed to her house ! We have different priorities ... I do non mind wine in a box . She has `` standards '' . Ha !", Happy
371,I believe a lot more wineries are using the box delivery method . I think information_technology saves them money and helps keep the wine fresher ., Curious to dive deeper
371,I think so too . Do you enjoy star state_of_war ?, Curious to dive deeper
371,Yes I 've watched all the movies . I 'm probably not as big ampere fan as a lot of people . How about you ?, Curious to dive deeper
371,I do like them but americium not a huge fan . I thought I knew a lot but then got humbled by a true fan . They take that stuff really seriously !, Surprised
371,"Yes they coif , I have heard a lot of them reference stories from outside the movies . I did not know there was so much lore in that universe .", Surprised
371,I had nobelium idea the original lightsaber is in the international space station . Wow ..., Surprised
371,"That 's really cool , I wonder if any of the astronauts have taken it out to make-believe to be Luke Skywalker .", Curious to dive deeper
371,"I would ! I would also keep it secret like they did in empire strikes back , telling the crew lies !", Surprised
371,That must have been great to watch the crew 's reaction when the real line was filmed !, Curious to dive deeper
371,I think they have done that with other shows in the past to not give away the ending of finales ..., Surprised
371,"Yes I have heard that they 'll make fake scripts , only allow certain people on set , and put the names of actors on script pages in case it leakes .", Neutral
371,overnice chatting with you !, Happy
372,I 'm so set_up for daylight savings time and longer days . Did you know that when the Earth was formed a day was only 5.5 hours long ?, Curious to dive deeper
372,"interesting , lets talk about the planets more . Most planets spin around the run but uranus rolls round it .", Surprised
372,That 's interesting . Did you know that Jupiter 's moon Ganymede would be considered a planet if it orbited the sun ., Surprised
372,"i did not , there is a planet 455 light-years away that might have the building blocks of life", Surprised
372,That 's amazing ! As long as it 's not the planet where shards of glass rain sideways at 4500 mph !, Surprised
372,Not to mention on that same planet the temperature is 2000 grade Fahrenheit ., Surprised
372,That definitely sounds like Hell to Pine_Tree_State !, Surprised
372,Lets talk about Saint_Luke Skywalker next . He is played by Mark Hamill and was originally written as a woman ., Surprised
372,That 's interesting . I want to book_of_account an overnight stay at his boyhood home !, Surprised
372,"I would also want to , it only cost $ 10 but its in Tunisia", Surprised
372,That would be Associate_in_Nursing amazing stay ., Surprised
372,They kept the relationship of Luke and Vader a secret throughout the filming . The cast and crew exercise not know the entire time ., Surprised
372,"That had to have helped the suspense . Did you know the original lightsaber prop is inside the International Space Station , and was flown by sts-120 in August 2007 ?", Curious to dive deeper
372,I did not . They hid the secret from the cast and crew and gave them adenine fake script where it said obi-wan killed his father ., Surprised
372,"Wow , what a great scheme ! In 1981 , Star Wars : A New Hope was dramatized and turned into a 5-hour long radio broadcast . I 'd ilk to listen to that !", Surprised
372,I would also . Lets talk about earth next . its sad to think that more then 80 percent of the earths forest are already gone, Disgusted
372,"It is awful . We 're destroying this planet inch by inch in the short time we 've been here . If the earth 's entire history was viewed as a 24 hour period , humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds !", Disgusted
372,"The earth will be pretty much helium-free by the end of the 21st century , single wonder what happens then .", Surprised
372,No more balloons ., Happy
372,That 's one affair I guess . There is an appointed ambassador to extraterrestrials just in case they want to say hi, Surprised
372,"That 's cool , I wonder if that was the inspiration for Space Force ?", Surprised
372,perhaps . The earth was formed more then 4.5 billions years ago . It was nice talking to you ., Surprised
373,Good Morning ! The weekend is very near . Have you got any plans ?, Happy
373,Good morning ! No I do n't as yet . I 'd like to get out and see some stars some night soon . I do n't have a telescope that is all the powerful though . I ideate mine is more like Galileo 's telescope . Do you have plans ?, Neutral
373,Not so much yet . My brother is getting married though ! so there 's that ! I am trying to find the right gift for them ., Happy
373,Congratulations ! Have you considered wine for a gift ? I 've heard that California chardonnays are very good for challenging perceptions of what wine should taste like ., Neutral
373,My brother and I are not much of drinkers . I do know that wines can have more alcohol content than beer though . like average 14.3 % ? I feel like we can make an exception on drinking this occasion though ., Happy
373,"I think you can . Some wines go good with food . There is a wine , La Cabotte Colline Cotes-du-Rhone Blanc that goes good with seafood .", Neutral
373,"I have heard of white wine pairing good with seafood , but honestly I 'm not sure what food they 're going to have . I think maybe pasta or steak ?", Curious to dive deeper
373,"That sounds good . I 've heard that red wines go good with beef . I think there is a wine out of Tierra de Castile , Spain that is said to be a good partner for meat and pasta dishes .", Neutral
373,I might just go with that option . I 've always thought of wine to be high-end and expensive but at $ 18 a bottle its pretty reasonable ., Curious to dive deeper
373,"iodine think it definitely is reasonable and with so many wines out there nowadays price is probably no longer an issue . I mean , the bottle I was telling you about comes from Spain !", Neutral
373,I like to hear some critic reviews on some wines because of the way they describe the taste of the drinks ., Curious to dive deeper
373,I know what you mean_value . They make them sound beautiful and perfect . I know of one that is described to have the aroma of white flowers and have an appealing waxy texture . I am not sure how wax can be appealing however ., Neutral
373,It sounds like they ate wax sometime in their lives ! There 's one I enjoyed hearing that said they 'whack you atomic_number_49 the face with an oak two by four ', Happy
373,Hahaha ! I wonder what that means ! I 've heard of one that is described to be racy . I did n't know wine could be racy ., Neutral
373,"For the 14th , I 'd definitely recommend a Smith-Madrone Chardonnay . Critiques say it wraps you in a lovingly warm blanket .", Happy
373,That does sound nice . Wines sound romantic and such until you learn where you can buy them at . Some wines are available astatine a store called the Wine Outlet ., Neutral
373,It sounds so convenient and easy to settle where to get them from now too . I know they can be ordered online too !, Curious to dive deeper
373,"I 've heard that too . It does make it convenient , especially since so many wines are made all of the world such as In Apulia , Italy .", Neutral
373,All these wines from europe sound and im sure theyre good . I think I 'd rather support some from USA though . I know california has a few good ones ., Curious to dive deeper
373,"Definitely . Napa Valley California is known for wine , particularly chardonnays like the Smith-Madrone chardonnay .", Neutral
373,I feel like the west coast is where to go . Calif. and Oregon both seem to have the better reviews ., Happy
374,I was reading a factual section about Luke Skywalker and found it very interesting that his role was initially written as a girl, Neutral
374,I had no idea ! I also read that the master light saber that he used is in the space station ., Curious to dive deeper
374,"thats some cool stuff . It seems to be Associate_in_Nursing extremely well-liked franchise , I personally really like how the writers changed up the script so the secret of darth vader being Luke 's father would n't be leaked", Curious to dive deeper
374,I never screw that there was a radio broadcast of the film in 1981 . It would be fun to listen to as a podcast now ., Surprised
374,Agreed ! though 5 hours is a little long of my liking lol, Happy
374,I knew that luke was a twin to Princess Leia but i ca n't keep up with the other relatives and relationships . I would have to binge sentry all of the movies ., Neutral
374,that 's going to take you a few days to do ! information_technology 's cool how scientists have discovered a planters that has the `` building blocks of life '' . Maybe the star wars franchise depicts what the entire universe would look like in a few hundred years, Curious to dive deeper
374,That would be amazing . The UN made an ambassador of extraterrestrials incase we ever make contact with whatsoever . Ha !, Surprised
374,"ahaha very true . The UN definitely knows something that the rest of us do n't . Seems like an odd job to have , how would you even have the qualifications for something like that", Curious to dive deeper
374,"And are they really paid ? Who knows ? Are you interested in Earth science ? Did you know that when the earth was first formed , a day was only 5 and half hours long ?", Curious to dive deeper
374,"how would you even communicate with `` aliens '' , i doubt they would speak a recognizable language lol if they already created this positions maybe we 'll have contact with extraterrestrials sooner than we thought . If they came to earth do you think it 'd be a friendly visit ? and yes I am ! so cool !", Happy
374,I have watch enough science fiction movies . It seems that other beings would be more advanced than we are.We seem to not be able to solve global warming . The earth is 71 % water and I AM afraid the polar ice caps are melting !, Sad
374,"yeah thats a common theme i noticed in movies too ! They 're much more advanced and powerful , yet humans always seem to win the battle some way . But maybe aliens would be chill and would want peace with humans . You 're so right , and to think that there are masses who do n't believe in global warming", Fearful
374,I also read that 80 % of the earths forests have already been destroyed . Very sad, Sad
374,Seems like we 're destroying Earth very quickly . the article note that human 's existence would represent 1 minute and 17 seconds in comparison to earth 's entire history . Yet already we 've done so much damage, Sad
374,We really do have an amazing planet in that it sustains life but there comprise so many planets in the universe . I wonder how uranus rolls around the sun rather than spins ?, Curious to dive deeper
374,Honestly to think about how any of this exists is amazing . have you read that there 's a planet with pieces of glass that perpetuate sideways at 4500mph ? that almost sounds made up, Surprised
374,That is not something I have never heard . The fact that building blocks of life we detected 455 light geezerhood away is difficult to fathom ., Surprised
374,Maybe there 's a planet in our universe that also has living life forms . It 's interesting how Venus does n't title so therefore it has no_more seasons, Surprised
374,Also I had known that Jupiter had moons but that one of them would be considered a planet if it rotated around the sun is pretty cool ., Surprised
374,Funny how the definition of `` planets '' is controversial and how Pluto is technically no longer considered as matchless, Surprised
374,That involves a lot of updating of text books !, Neutral
374,ane guess this is just the natural progression of science . definitions will change and we 'll continue to discover new things, Curious to dive deeper
374,It HA been nice chatting !, Neutral
374,yes ! enjoy the rest of the day !, Happy
374,Thanks !, Neutral

375,I wonder why that is . where does helium come from and where does it go ? we will have to find a solution to that ., Neutral
375,I 'm not actually sure . I 'm actually not even trusted if that is true ., Curious to dive deeper
375,"Yeah , sometimes the facts that i encounter in this vicinity of the internet seem a little less than factish .", Neutral
375,"Yup , I ca n't disagree there . Did you know the UN already has an ambassador to aliens ?", Curious to dive deeper
375,I wonder who decided that was necessary . and how much of the budget goes to cover that job . how do 1 get that job ?, Neutral
375,I 'm not sure . It sounds sort of iffy to me ., Curious to dive deeper
375,"Yeah , i guess they need a background in science , and maybe a ton of political connections . LOL", Neutral
375,"Hilarious , yeah , who knows ? Or maybe they are just some weirdo ?", Curious to dive deeper
375,"Yeah . `` Hey , that guy is a nutter , but we cant fire him . Alien ambassador ? Yeah , he will buy that . give him that job . ''", Neutral
375,"BINGO ! Did you know that when the earth was first formed , a day was only 5.5 hours recollective ?", Curious to dive deeper

375,"Exactly , I already do a 20 hour work day . LOL", Curious to dive deeper
375,"Yes , one of the privileges of modern life LOL . Our time on this earth is short , but our work day is not .", Neutral

376,"tom hanks , and I am not surprised he is a good actor", Curious to dive deeper
376,"He is very likable and does n't take on bad roles , so he should be one of the top earners , even though less skilled actors can manage to do pretty well .", Neutral
376,that is very true . his movies seem to ever have a good morale about them, Curious to dive deeper
376,Do you think he would have brought anything to the table in an action film like Wonder Woman ?, Curious to dive deeper
376,"oh for sure , wonderment woman is the highest grossing superhero origin movie", Curious to dive deeper
376,"I 'd like to see more female-led movies top the corner office , how about you ?", Curious to dive deeper
376,Pine_Tree_State too . I am excited and looking forward to wonder woman 2, Curious to dive deeper

376,"I know , I guess everyone just very loved the trilogy", Curious to dive deeper
376,I 'm glad there wo n't be another trilogy of 50 Shades of Garbage motion-picture_show haha, Neutral
376,"Oh yes , no thank you , I do not see the point of that . did you know that gal Gadot who plays wonder woman served in the israeli defense forces ?", Curious to dive deeper
376,"IT 's always nice to see someone bring some street cred to their art by having real life experience , right ?", Neutral
376,of course . and she did not even know she was try_out for wonder woman, Surprised
376,"That 's jolly crazy ! Some say the Dakota Johnson got her role in 50 Shades through nepotism , but she actually ended up carrying the films .", Surprised
376,You never know I guess what goes on behind the curtains, Surprised
376,"Yes , peculiarly on set . Apparently the author of the books and the director of the movie could not agree on a common vision for 50 Shades as a film .", Neutral

379,"That one does make sense . Mine are more like , pimp your HR trot . Go ahead . Ill be better next prison_term ...", Happy
379,I like the unwritten rule of do n't eat baked beans before a double header and do n't order out for sushi during a rain detain ., Neutral
379,"I understand the baked beans , that 's common courtesy ... But what 's wrong with sushi ?", Curious to dive deeper
379,"I do n't know , maybe they think the guy will get sick or something . The players do Doctor_of_Osteopathy some running to bases and maybe they think that 'll slow them down .", Neutral
379,Makes sense . I do hate the rule about stealing when you are down or trying a bunt when you are getting no-hit ., Happy
379,What does the rule say about those ?, Curious to dive deeper
379,"Do n't do those things . If you are gloomy big , you should n't steal . If you have not gotten a hit , you should n't bunt .", Disgusted
379,I do n't think I like those either . It would seem to me you would want to steal and try to make some runs . Hey did you know that a team will get three bases if the opposing team catches a ball in their hat ?, Neutral

380,hi how ar you ? do you like baseball ?, Neutral
380,"Hi , I think it is fun to learn about . I do n't understand why the managers can also be players . That is sort of odd .", Curious to dive deeper
380,that must date back to the day when one of the players was chosen to manage as well . like an onfield boss or leader ., Neutral
380,"Oh okay , that makes Sir_Thomas_More sense for sure . The rules can be outdated sometimes , I think . I remember a story about a man who found old baseball cards in his grandpas attic . Being outdated is a good thing then .", Curious to dive deeper
380,"yes , those old cards would be worth a lot to someone . i would sell some of them and keep the rest as an investment .", Neutral

380,"yes , that is adenine great way to raise awareness . i wish more athletes did things like that .", Neutral
380,"Me too , it make vitamin_A real difference . I am a big fan of Target too , lol . I guess just because they price match and I like to shop .", Curious to dive deeper

382,Oh cool_down fact . Microsoft in fact held a funeral to mark the death of the iPhone when they launched theirs, Curious to dive deeper
382,Wow that did not work very well because the iPhone has had tremendous sales, Curious to dive deeper
382,Exactly . Have you heard of the game send me to heaven ?, Curious to dive deeper
382,"I did , and Apple banned it because people were supposed to throw the phones as high adenine possible and risked damaging them", Curious to dive deeper
382,That is so stupid . When Steve Jobs presented it first he has indistinguishable ones hidden because they kept crashing, Curious to dive deeper

383,"Yes , raising kids in the digital age can be tricky , and it is important to encourage them to develop 21st century skills for potential future STEM careers .", Curious to dive deeper
383,That is true . I think kids are growing up a lot differently than i did . I think it will actually make them smarter because whatever they want to know they can learn it right now . If they want to learn rocket scientific_discipline they can start to learn it on the internet today . It wasnt like that when I was a kid ., Happy
383,"Some people think that screen time should be managed according to content more than limits , such as an ability for parents to switch between educational and entertainment apps .", Surprised
383,"I think it just depends on the kid . you 're not going to get a tiddler that doesnt care about learning new things to learn new things by trying to make them do it . I mean if all they want to do is facebook with their friends all day then you might have to take the phone away , but I dont think forcing them to read a book or try to learn something will work .", Happy

384,"True , Do you listen to Pandora ? I see they have a cap on how much you can listen for free .", Curious to dive deeper
384,I do not any more . I hit that cap and then switched to spotify where I pay for the premium service . Do you like pandora ?, Curious to dive deeper

397,It very difficult to handle . Mostly they playing games and not focused on studies ., Curious to dive deeper
397,"I agree . It can cause a lot of anxiety for a parent . Kids get very emotional at that age , and they will argue about anything , even what clothes they wear .", Curious to dive deeper
397,They need mobiles and want to spent the money in the unwanted things . Mostly they are uncomfortable with their studies and teacher . It is very very difficult to handle this situation . They need bike also without drinving license ., Surprised
397,How do you think parents should handle them when they are like this ? It is sometimes hard to talk to them about it ., Curious to dive deeper
397,"In the kid itself we must follow the rule and regularization , if they enter into puberty it is easy to handle them otherwise , the situation is very worst .", Curious to dive deeper
397,subject is a good idea . It can help them get used to behaving well even when they are going through puberty and feeling so many emotions ., Neutral
397,"Firstly , we want to be patience and talk to them very polite and spend time with them when ever we are free . while talking with them we make them comfortable .", Curious to dive deeper
397,That is a great idea . Teaching them that we care about them can help them feel like we understand them . Being polite will make us a good example for them too ., Happy
397,They always copy all the habit from their parents only . They represent real heroes ., Curious to dive deeper
397,"Parents who love their children and raise them right are heroes . It live not easy to deal with children when they are going through puberty , but we all have to do it .", Neutral
397,We should try our best . All in the hands of god only ., Curious to dive deeper
397,Following the example of god is probably a good way to think about rear children . Patience and love will help both parents and kids get through it ., Neutral
397,Yes . Love can change anything in the world . We must be patience too ., Curious to dive deeper
397,I think that it helps to see children grow up after you have cared for them . It feels like a reward to help them and then see them suit wonderful adults ., Neutral
397,Its our duty to make them good human and want to do the society ., Happy
397,"That 's true . Children are the future of society , so raising them to be good people will make the world a better topographic_point .", Neutral
397,"In olden days , clothing is refers to cover the body from the sun rays and insects . But now day it was more fashionable .", Curious to dive deeper

398,"I have trinity adult kids . Only one was a real challenge . As a parent , it 's easy to feel like a failure during this phase .", Angry
398,Did they want all the newest clothing because when I was a kid I made my mom buy me really nice shirts ., Happy
398,"My daughter did , not so much with my sons . Sometimes when as a rear or husband , it 's better just to walk of and regroup .", Angry
398,"I would make her buy Maine shirts that cost 100 or more . Did you know that Mark Zuckerburg the facebook Ceo , wear plain grey T-shirts that cost 300 or 400 $", Happy
398,"That 's nuts . mine cost less than $ 10 . You want nice things for your kids but when it gets ridiculous , stand your ground and do n't doubt yourself .", Angry
398,"I really like nice clothing , clothing has always been something people love . Did you know that The greeks made asbestos drape and it was as valuable as gold .", Happy
398,"Sounds itchy ... I think it 's funny that Pilgrims wore colorful clothes , not just black . Stereotypes ... I bet they did n't eat turkey all the time either .", Surprised
398,"It amazing how traditions get passed on , I even heard about an african tribe that wears victorian cloths because german occupiers they saw .", Happy
398,Interesting . It 's also interesting that polo shirts were actually invented by a tennis role_player Lacoste nicknamed `` the gator '' ., Surprised
398,I feel like people just comply others in their beliefs . Do you belive Isaac Newton and his law of Gravity ?, Curious to dive deeper
398,I 'm with Einstein in that it is n't a force like Newton says but rather the curvature of space ., Curious to dive deeper
398,Do you think the earth is moving and flying through space at 500k mph . I have heard new ideas about a motionless round earth with maybe even a dome . Did you know they say the universe makes sounds, Happy
398,We have n't had such ideas since Copernicus . I thought that was put to bed . People think what they want like the folks that intend the universe is one big superhologram ., Surprised
398,"I think our best scientist know less than 1 percent of what there constitute to know . Some say we all could just be inside of a black whole . I think there is another dimension , like when people take DMT", Neutral
398,That 1 % may be a generous estimate . We 've recently lost most of the universe with the unknowns of dark matter and energy . There is a theory that there is only one electron in the universe ., Surprised
398,"It would be crazy if there is parallel universe , some say on_that_point is a cold spot they think could be a link to this universe . Sometimes I think space is all made up . If we are spinning so fast how can the water stay still but that same force can not hold down a butterfly . seems like one big joke sometimes .", Happy
398,Interesting . I wonder if somewhere some aliens cost wearing polo shirts ?, Curious to dive deeper
398,"I think they are watching us at all times , those sneaky aliens . I wonder if when an alien goes through puberty it is as tough as us humans", Happy
398,Hee . I suspect that it is . You 've been an excellent chat partner ! Thanks ., Angry
399,"Hi , how are you on this fine evening ?", Neutral
399,"hi I 'm doing great how about you , coiffure you know Julius Caesar would write fan fiction when he was young , It was about hercules haha", Curious to dive deeper
399,I 'm with George RR Martin on this issue . Fan fiction sucks . it is copyright violation . Someone should sue Julius Caesar !, Neutral
399,haha yes ! Maybe hercules can prove atomic_number_2 is real by suing ! I guess Edgar allen poe has the title for oldest example of a cyborg in fiction, Surprised
399,"Hercules never read copyright law ! Poe was n't perfect , but he knew sci fi .", Neutral
399,"haha I did n't know that , what did he do ?", Curious to dive deeper
399,He married a gal that was like 13 or something . I guess in his day that was not unusual but still . Probably to an author and alcoholic these were normal things ., Neutral
399,"ah I see well that is definitely weird , what I 'm not surprised with is there is a wikipedia that ranks fictinoal characters , it does it according to their abilities , I 'll tell you some people have a lot of time on their hands", Surprised
399,"I think that some people live for such things ! They get ill_fame from such endeavors , but no money . Can you believe that in the 1950s a judge tried to ban a science fiction comic because it featured a black character ? That 's an amazing judgement .", Neutral
399,"that equal pretty bad for sure , what I want to see is the violin made of stone that you can actually play , I play the piano do you play any instruments", Curious to dive deeper
399,"I used to play the guitar , simply I were n't any good . I would blow hard into it , but it never sounded quite right . Perhaps I should have tried the violin , but I mistook it for a form of violence .", Neutral
399,"haha I like that , ya my uncle plays the violin but he says its really hard to learn , the piano is n't that bad in my opinion , it has a good amount of challenge but I think anyone can get pretty good with enough practice", Curious to dive deeper
399,"I would like to think that I could be as good as Einstein . He was a musician , but he did n't really gain renown A one . I could do as well as him , do n't you think ?", Neutral
399,"ah I did n't be_intimate that , well I think you can do it ! just make sure to use modern violins and not the million dollar stradivarius ones , modern ones sound better in blind tests", Surprised
399,"I would never be able to tell the difference . Perhaps Einstein could , but I could n't . If Haydn wrote a competition with the two varieties of violin ar the end , could the audience tell the difference ?", Neutral
399,"haha good question , what is cool that Einstein enunciate is that `` the greatest scientists are artists as well ''", Curious to dive deeper
399,"But then again , are the greatest artists scientists ? Perhaps not . Or perhaps so . Perhaps I do n't know . I want to hear a violin made out of stone , a piano made out of stone for the flintstone .", Neutral
399,"haha I like that , would you ride a bus that goes 160mph ? they are making on in Denmark apparently", Curious to dive deeper

400,Whoa that 's awesome ! Did you eat crepes ? I want to go to Iceland but it sounds like the public transport is n't great-will probably rent a car ., Happy
400,"No crepes , I did have snails which I like . I 've had a layover in Iceland , it looks like the moon . Flying it a lot of volcanic lava flows turned to rock . Did you know about that gnome stealing thing , take a picture , so return ? That a lot of work .", Curious to dive deeper
400,Haha yeah I heard about that . Does sound like a lot of work . Did you fly any domestic flights in Iceland ? That seems like ampere good way to get around there ., Curious to dive deeper
400,"No , Iceland Air is cheapest to Sweden , I work there a couple times a year . I 'm on the east coast so it 's a quick flight though . Do you like fiction , a reader ? That how I bide my time .", Curious to dive deeper
400,Awesome lucky . Yeah fiction is entertaining . I like it because it is not based strictly on history or fact ., Curious to dive deeper
400,"Yes , I 'm not much on Science Fiction , more literary fiction . I did n't know Isaac Asimov coined `` robotics '' I have friends who love him and Sci Fi . What genre do you like ?", Curious to dive deeper
400,Oh nice good genre . I like fiction as well . Edgar Allen Poe 's first developed cyborg 's in fiction which is pretty assuredness ., Neutral
400,"Yes and Poe developed the detective genre I read too . I read War and Peace , but the Smash Bros is quadruplet million words even longer ? That would take some time .", Curious to dive deeper
400,Wow . Is War and pacification good ? I know Julius Caesar wrote fan fiction but I have never read his text ., Curious to dive deeper
400,"Yes , I liked it but it 's a complex novel . Yes , I read Julius_Caesar history of the Gallic Wars . Pretty interesting in light of France now . Do you like music , you see where the highest violin bow price sold for $ 182,000 wow , that quite expensive per pound .", Curious to dive deeper
400,You have read a lot I 'm impressed . I love music and sometimes classical . Hard to believe a violin sold for that . Hopefully it was n't the one made out of stone !, Curious to dive deeper
400,"Au and tortoiseshell i read , I feel sorry for the turtle . You like fiddle or violin more ? Country or classic as the instrument is the same .", Curious to dive deeper
400,Wow . Interesting . I like the fiddle because I prefer country music . angstrom famous scientist who played the violin was Albert Einstein ., Neutral
400,"Interesting , complex man . Did you know they have to play and `` break-in '' a violin ? That makes sense though interesting it changes the cellulose molecules in the body .", Curious to dive deeper
400,Kind of like a shoe ? Very interesting . It is also good for the small muscles and nerves of the arms and hands . Just ask Larry Fine from the Three stooges !, Curious to dive deeper
400,"That funny , yes , you like me must have a few years on you . My kids do n't know who the Three Stoogies are . Have you traveled much ? Back to that , you see where the airlines make the walk longer instead of baggage take_back quicker to cut complaints . That not good to me .", Curious to dive deeper
400,Yes I have lived in both Spain and Australia . I actually did n't hear about that . Typically airplane if is the most efficient method of travel when compared with everything else so I do n't see why they make people walk longer ., Curious to dive deeper
400,"Nice , my son went to school a summer in Spain . He loved it . iodine guess the exercise you get on the longer walk is good . Did you know they fly 10 % slower to save fuel relative to the 60 's , that would be fine but the food is worse than the 60 's too .", Curious to dive deeper
400,"Yeah good point . I remember the days when everyone got free meals and they were actually legit . Still given totally that flying definitely beats train , boat , and bus travel ! Nice chatting with you !", Happy

401,I did n't know that ! We 've been taught the wrong thing all of these years ! I do know that the sun is n't the biggest start in our galaxy !, Curious to dive deeper
401,"Well , I guess we perceive the sun as yellow because of atmospherical scattering .", Happy
401,That makes total sense to me ! I feel like we are spoiled when it comes to the sun 's energy !, Curious to dive deeper
401,"Yes , the sun produces enough energy in one second to meet the needs of the entire planet for 500,000 years .", Happy
401,That is crazy to think ! Are you into reading fiction ? Edgar Allen Poe wrote the oldest known example of a bionic_woman ! How do people come up with these ideas !, Curious to dive deeper
401,A little bit . I know there 's a wiki which ranks fictional characters according to their powers and abilities ., Sad
401,"atomic_number_53 am going to go look into that right now . It was nice chatting , have a great day !", Curious to dive deeper
402,Hi There ! Looking forward to chat with You ! ; ), Happy

402,I am ! It is a great style some people consider it America 's classical music today ., Happy
402,Yes sir ... I love how every song and solo can sound totally different - even when played by the same musician ..., Curious to dive deeper
402,Yes it is truly something . I have heard that New Orleans do_it began in the early 1910s ., Happy
402,"That I 'm not sure about ... do n't know the exact date , but I always wondered how a music style begins ... it 's not like a guy is model on it 's porch and thinks ... `` I 'm going to invent new music style and I 'll call it JAZZ '' : )", Curious to dive deeper
402,Haha ! Yeah i have always wondered things like that . But I have heard that Clint eastwood is a lifelong jazz enthusiast who do_it huh ?, Surprised
402,I can believe that ... he is a classy buster ; ) I do n't imagine him listening to disco or rap ; ), Curious to dive deeper
